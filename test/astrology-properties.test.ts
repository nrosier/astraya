// Gauquelin sectors ('G') are numbered in the opposite rotational direction

// decrease around the circle rather than increase. That is a deliberate,
// documented convention (see houses.ts on 'G' being the cuspCount exception),
// not a bug, but it means the "forward and sums to 360" check below needs a
// direction to assume.
//
// The alternative Sunshine system ('i', sunshineAlt) is excluded for a
// different reason: it is Sun-relative, so its degeneracy latitude tracks the
// Sun's declination on the given date rather than being fixed like Placidus
// and Koch's ~66.5 degrees. Verified by sweeping latitude at two dates: at an
// equinox (low declination) even 75 degrees is fine, but near a solstice
// (declination close to its ~23.4 degree max) cusps start winding 3x at just
// under 59 degrees. Since this property test's dates range across the whole
// shipped epoch, no single latitude bound would be safe here without
// needlessly restricting the other systems, which don't have this issue.
// The original Sunshine system ('I') was checked under the same conditions
// and does not show it.
//
// The Horizon system ('H') is *not* excluded, unlike 'G' and 'i' above, even
// though it has its own degeneracy near the celestial equator (#184): its
// zone is not a fixed neighborhood around the equator but tracks the RAMC for
// the given date and time — sweeping latitude at two dates found it winding
// 11x from just past latitude 0 out to roughly 10 degrees on one date, and
// only right at 0 on another. Since RAMC varies with every random date and
// hour this property test generates, no fixed latitude bound or small
// excluded neighborhood could safely dodge it (an earlier attempt to exclude
// 'H' outright for exactly this reason is what this comment replaces).
// Root-caused instead: the raw `swe_houses_ex2` cusps for 'H' really do wind
// several times around the ecliptic in this configuration, verified directly
// against the engine before any normalisation runs — not a units/modulo bug
// in this codebase. `engine.ts`'s `houses()` now detects that winding and
// throws `EphemerisError` rather than handing back the bogus cusps, so the
// property below treats a thrown error for 'H' as a valid, expected outcome
// (see the try/catch) instead of excluding the system from coverage.
