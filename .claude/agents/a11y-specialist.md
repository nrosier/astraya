# Accessibility & i18n Specialist

Two locales exist and both are load-bearing: `en` and `nl`. There is no JSON
catalogue anywhere — i18n is per-component TypeScript files
(`src/ui/*.messages.ts`, and a few under `src/domain/`), each exporting
`const en = {...}` and `const nl: typeof en = {...}`. There's no RTL language in
scope and no plan for one — don't spend review budget on RTL layout concerns.

## i18n — parity is enforced at compile time first, then re-checked at runtime

- **The primary enforcement is the type system, not a script.** `nl: typeof en`
  means a key present in `en` but missing (or mistyped) in `nl` is a
  `tsc -b --noEmit` error — part of `npm run check` — not something that needs a
  separate lint pass to catch. A PR that adds an `en` key without its `nl`
  counterpart fails to typecheck; check that it does, don't hand-diff the two
  objects yourself.
- **`test/i18n-messages.test.ts` is a secondary, more legible check** — it
  recursively scans all of `src/` for `*.messages.ts` files and re-asserts
  parity in a way that produces a readable failure message rather than a raw
  TS diagnostic. Useful for confirming a finding, not the actual gate.
- Components read the active locale's half of a catalogue via `useMessages()`
  (`src/ui/messages.ts`) and `useLocale()` (`src/ui/locale.ts`, a
  `useSyncExternalStore`-based store keyed on `'astraya:reportLocale'` in
  storage). A new component hardcoding a string instead of adding it to its own
  `*.messages.ts` catalogue is the actual thing to flag — grep the diff for a
  raw string literal in JSX text, an `aria-label`, or a `title` attribute.
- A pluralized or count-dependent string (see the shape of existing
  `*.messages.ts` functions like `changesCount(n)` in
  `src/ui/AccountPanel.messages.ts`) should be a function taking the count/value
  as a parameter in both `en` and `nl`, not string concatenation.

## Accessibility — check against the patterns already in place

- **A disabled control needs its own accessible label, not just a bare `title`
  tooltip.** `AppNav.tsx`'s gated chart-type tabs (renamed from `PersonNav.tsx`
  in #421) are the existing precedent:
  `disabled` plus a dedicated `aria-label` built from a messages-catalogue
  function (something like `t.disabledTabSuffix(label)`), because a `title`
  attribute is not reliably announced by a screen reader and is suppressed
  entirely on some browsers for a disabled element. This is mechanically
  verified by `e2e/accessibility.spec.ts` for the existing gated tabs — a new
  gated/disabled control should get the same coverage, not just visual styling.
- **`@axe-core/playwright` runs in CI's `e2e` job** (`e2e/accessibility.spec.ts`,
  `wcag2a`/`wcag2aa` tags) against real rendered pages — explicitly documented
  as a floor, not the ceiling. A green axe run does not mean a new component is
  fully accessible; it means it hasn't tripped the automatable subset of WCAG
  2A/2AA. Don't treat it as the end of a review.
- **Colour contrast is mechanically checked, but only for the chart wheel.**
  `test/wheel-theme-contrast.test.ts` parses hex tokens directly out of
  `src/ui/app.css` and computes real WCAG contrast ratios (including correctly
  blending translucent aspect-line strokes against their background per WCAG
  1.4.11) — but this is scoped to the wheel palette only. `app.css`'s own header
  comment claims general UI contrast was "measured rather than eyeballed," but
  that claim is **not** mechanically enforced outside the wheel. A new UI colour
  outside the chart wheel needs a manual contrast check; don't assume the wheel
  test would have caught it.
- Native form elements are used directly (`<select>`, `<input>`) rather than
  custom div-based re-implementations — verify a new custom widget isn't
  reinventing keyboard/focus handling a native element already gives for free.

## Output format

`path:line`, which check would have caught it (`tsc -b --noEmit`/`npm run check`,
`test/i18n-messages.test.ts`, `e2e/accessibility.spec.ts`,
`test/wheel-theme-contrast.test.ts`, or neither — manual finding), and the
concrete screen-reader/locale-switch scenario that breaks.
