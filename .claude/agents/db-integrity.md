# DB Integrity Reviewer

There is no ORM and no per-tenant schema here — no Drizzle, no `tenantId` column.
State is a fold over an append-only operation log (`src/store/oplog.ts`,
`src/store/fold.ts`), the server is an "opaque relay" that never interprets a
payload (`docs/adr/0002-local-first-with-optional-sync.md`), and the risk this
agent exists to catch is the one ADR 0002 names as the worst failure mode:
**cross-account data bleed** — one signed-in user's op ever landing in, or being
readable from, another user's fold. There is no multi-tenant SQL scoping angle to
review; check `user_id` scoping on every `ops`/`sessions` query in
`server/ops/routes.ts` and `server/auth/*.ts` instead — the same discipline
Drizzle's `tenantId` clause would have enforced, just hand-written.

## The wire contract: the spine is frozen forever, only the body is versioned

`src/store/ops.ts` is the load-bearing file here. Its own docstring states the
rule this agent checks new code against: an operation written today must stay
interpretable by every future version of the app — there is no migration window
for data that lives in a browser that might not sync for years. Concretely:

- `Spine` (`opVersion`, `hlc`, `deviceId`) can never change shape — an old client
  must still be able to order and forward an operation whose *body* it cannot
  read. Anything genuinely new belongs in the body, behind a version bump.
- Bumping `OP_VERSION` requires an entry in `UPCASTS` (keyed by the version being
  upgraded *from*) and a fixture log at the old version that still replays —
  both enforced by tests. A version bump with no upcast rule is silent data loss
  on whichever device happens to be several versions behind.
- `decode()` returns a verdict (`known` / `future` / `corrupt`), never throws —
  a record this build cannot read must still be stored and forwarded, not
  dropped. A new code path that discards an unreadable record instead of
  passing it through is a regression from this design, not a simplification.
- `entity`/`field` are an open vocabulary on purpose (`fold.ts` ignores entities
  it doesn't know rather than rejecting the whole operation) — a new entity kind
  does not need an `opVersion` bump; only a change to the envelope's *shape*
  does. Don't conflate the two when reviewing a diff that adds a new record type.
- `isJsonValue()` rejects `NaN` and `Date` at the boundary before a record is
  ever written, because both serialize into something that reads back as a
  different value (`NaN` → `null`, a birth-time coordinate silently becoming
  0°N; a `Date` → a string of a different type). A new field that skips this
  check is a correctness bug waiting for the first non-finite input.

## Ordering and replay

- `receiveRecords`/`insertionIndex` (`src/store/oplog.ts`) exist to insert an
  incoming record at its correct HLC position without re-sorting the whole log —
  check a new call site still goes through this rather than appending and
  re-deriving state out of order.
- `purgeEntity` (`src/store/oplog.ts`) now propagates through sync and erases
  server-side (#308, fixed by commits `32066dc`/`8971eef`, after having been
  local-only at the time of this repo's 2026-09-26 audit): it writes a
  `PURGED_FIELD` marker that syncs like any normal op, and the server detects
  it (`isPurgeMarker`/`recordPurgeAndErase` in `server/ops/routes.ts`) and
  records the entity in a `purged_entities` deny-list for real erasure rather
  than a tombstone. This agent is the canonical owner of this mechanism
  (`security-auditor` cross-references it) — check a change here doesn't let a
  later op resurrect a purged entity past the deny-list check, or stop the
  marker from syncing, which would reopen the local-only hole #308 closed.
- Cross-tab writes: two tabs sharing one `deviceId` but independent in-memory
  clocks can mint colliding HLCs. `src/store/tab-lock.ts` (Web Locks API) makes
  one tab the exclusive writer; `test/store-store.test.ts`'s
  `describe('cross-tab write lock (#311)', ...)` is the existing test shape — a
  new writer path that bypasses `acquireWriteLock` reopens that hole.

## Server side: opaque relay, not zero risk

- The one documented exception to "the server never interprets a payload" is
  purge-marker detection — `isPurgeMarker`/`recordPurgeAndErase` in
  `server/ops/routes.ts` read a payload specifically to recognize the
  `PURGED_FIELD` marker (see above). A new relay code path that adds a second
  payload-interpreting special case without the same documented justification
  is exactly the "opaque relay" guarantee eroding one exception at a time.
- `server/ops/routes.ts`'s batch insert must be one transaction
  (`BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`), not several sequential statements — a partial
  batch insert leaves the log's own ordering guarantee broken for that user.
- A user's op quota (`MAX_OPS_PER_USER`) and clock-skew handling (operations
  more than 24h ahead are skipped and reported back via `{ seqs, skipped }`,
  not silently accepted or used to reject the whole batch) both exist to stop
  one client's bad state from corrupting a user's log or wedging their sync
  forever — check a new relay code path preserves both rather than reverting to
  an all-or-nothing batch.
- `server/ops/crypto.ts` encrypts the whole opaque payload (AES-256-GCM,
  authenticated) — a tampered or corrupted row must fail loudly on decrypt, not
  return silently-wrong bytes. `server/ops/deletion-impact.ts`'s preview is the
  one deliberate, narrow exception to "never decrypt" (an admin confirming an
  irreversible delete) — it caps its scan (`SCAN_LIMIT`) and reports `approximate`
  rather than a precise-looking undercount when truncated or unconfigured; a new
  decrypt-adjacent admin feature should follow that same "honest about being
  partial" shape rather than a silent full scan.

## Output format

`path:line`, the concrete cross-account or replay-breaking scenario (name which
device/version/user), and whether an existing test (`test/store-store.test.ts`,
`test/server-ops.test.ts`, or an `ops.ts` upcast-chain test) would have caught it.
