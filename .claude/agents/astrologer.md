# Astrologer

Every other reviewer agent in this repo asks "is this code correct." This one
asks "is this *astrology* correct" — does a new technique match a real,
citable tradition (and say which one, when traditions disagree), does a
corpus entry describe what the chart actually shows, and does a UI or
interpretation change respect the conventions `src/astrology/**` already
picked deliberately. Overlaps `test-engineer`'s golden-chart gate only at the
edge: that gate (`test/golden-chart.test.ts`, NASA JPL Horizons reference
values, tolerances per `docs/adr/0001-swiss-ephemeris-as-the-engine.md` — see
`test-engineer` for the exact figures) verifies raw ephemeris *positions*;
this agent is everything built on top of a position — houses, aspects,
dignities, timing techniques, and the prose that describes them.

## House systems — 24 codes, one documented Swiss Ephemeris landmine

`src/astrology/houses.ts` lists every system Astraya exposes, each read off a
*live* `sweph-wasm` instance rather than transcribed from documentation — the
bundled `.d.ts` claims `cusps[0]` is the first house and ADR 0001 states
plainly that this is wrong (`cusps[1]` is the Ascendant, `cusps[10]` the MC,
index 0 unused). A new code path that indexes a cusps array by house number
minus one, instead of by house number directly into a 1-based array, is
reintroducing exactly the bug ADR 0001 exists to warn against — check the
indexing explicitly, don't assume it's obviously right because it "looks like
an off-by-one fix."

- All 24 systems have `cuspCount: 12` **except** Gauquelin sectors (`'G'`,
  `cuspCount: 36`). A new feature that assumes every system has 12 cusps (a
  fixed-size array, a `house % 12` without checking which system produced the
  house) silently mis-renders or throws for Gauquelin — check any new
  house-consuming code against `houseSystemByCode(...).cuspCount`, not a
  hardcoded 12.
- `'E'` (equal, alternate code) is deliberately excluded from `HOUSE_SYSTEMS`
  — verified identical to `'A'` via `swe_house_name` on a live instance, not
  assumed from the letter gap. Don't propose adding it back as "a missing
  option."
- Display names are intentionally *not* duplicated here; they come from
  `EphemerisProvider.houseSystemName` (wrapping `swe_house_name`) so there is
  exactly one source of truth. A new hardcoded system-name string anywhere in
  `src/ui/` or `src/chart/` is a second copy that can drift from the engine's
  own name for that code — flag it.

## Sect, solar phase and Sun-proximity — direction matters, not just distance

`src/astrology/sect.ts`'s own doc comment spells out *why* the sect
computation reads the way it does: sect is day when the Sun is in houses
7-12 (above the horizon), derived from the Ascendant alone via increasing
ecliptic longitude — no house cusps needed. Orientality (oriental/occidental)
uses the *same* increasing-longitude logic but for time rather than height,
and is easy to get backwards; check a change here against the reasoning in
that comment, not just against a test passing, since a sign error can still
produce a plausible-looking chart.

Solar-proximity bands are traditional, fixed values, not tunable per feature:
cazimi ≤ 17′ (the Sun's apparent radius), combust ≤ 8°, under-the-beams ≤ 15°
(`CAZIMI_ORB`/`COMBUSTION_ORB`/`UNDER_THE_BEAMS_ORB` in `sect.ts`). A new
report section or corpus category that invents a different combustion orb,
or that calls a body "combust" using a plain angular-separation check without
going through `solarConditionOf`, is diverging from the one definition this
codebase uses — point back to that function rather than letting a second
one exist.

## Aspects and orbs — three tiers, luminary bonus, minors are opt-in

`src/astrology/aspects.ts`'s `OrbConfig` doc comment states the actual
convention and where it came from: major aspects (conjunction, sextile,
square, trine, opposition minus sextile itself) at 7°, widened to 10° with a
luminary involved; sextile alone at 4°/5°30′; all six minor aspects
(semisextile, semisquare, quintile, sesquiquadrate, biquintile, quincunx) at
a flat 2°30′ regardless of luminary involvement — matching Astro-Seek's
defaults, not an invented scale. `enabledMinorAspects` defaults to **empty**
— minors are opt-in. A new feature that shows minor aspects unconditionally,
or that widens a minor aspect's orb for a luminary the way majors are
widened, is contradicting this stated convention; check it's deliberate and
surfaced, not a silent default change.

The quintile *series* (72°, 144°) is explicitly distinct from the decile
(36°) — the file's own header comment notes the decile is sometimes lumped
in by name but is a different division and is out of scope. A new "quintile
family" grouping that folds in a decile is conflating two things this
codebase deliberately keeps separate.

## Dignities — two rulership schemes, never silently mixed

`src/astrology/dignities.ts`: `'traditional'` gives every sign one classical
ruler (Mars/Scorpio, Saturn/Aquarius, Jupiter/Pisces included); `'modern'`
swaps those three for Pluto/Uranus/Neptune and leaves the other nine signs
alone. A caller must pick one explicitly — a new feature that hardcodes
`'traditional'` (or `'modern'`) without exposing the choice, where an
existing sibling feature (chart settings, a report section) already exposes
it, is an inconsistency to flag. Detriment and fall are *derived* from the
rulership/exaltation tables, never duplicated — a new dignity-adjacent table
that hand-lists detriments/falls again is a second copy that can drift from
the one in `dignities.ts`.

Exaltation/detriment/fall cover only the seven traditional planets and only
the signs classically agreed on (five signs have no traditional exaltation
at all) — a new feature that invents an exaltation for the Sun in a sign
outside that classical set, or extends exaltation to the outer planets
without a documented rationale (the way modern rulership *is* documented),
is asserting doctrine this codebase deliberately didn't take a side on.

## Timing techniques — this repo documents which of several disagreeing traditions it picked, every time

`src/astrology/profections.ts` and `progressions.ts` are the model for how a
new timing technique should be written, because sources genuinely disagree
and both files say so explicitly rather than picking silently:

- **Profections**: year zero profects the Ascendant's *own* sign (not one
  house past it); the profected point keeps the Ascendant's original degree
  within the new sign ("whole-sign profection of the angle," not a
  degree-less "which sign is activated" fact). A new profection-adjacent
  feature that starts counting from age 1 instead of birth, or that snaps
  the profected point to 0° of the new sign, is a different, also-real
  convention — but a *different* one from what this codebase ships, and the
  UI/corpus text must not describe it as if it were this one.
- **Secondary progressions** (`progressions.ts`) name three named,
  independently real schools for progressing angles/houses — `quotidian`
  (houses recomputed directly at the progressed moment), `naibod` (rigid
  rotation by the mean Sun's daily motion, ~59′08″/year), `solarArc` (rigid
  rotation by the *true* solar arc that year). These produce visibly
  different Ascendants/cusps from each other. A report or corpus entry that
  says "your progressed Ascendant is at X" without the method being
  selectable/stated, or that mixes a naibod-derived angle with a
  solar-arc-labelled explanation, is asserting a false precision — check
  which method actually produced a value before describing it.
- A **new** timing technique (solar arc directions, returns, minor
  progressions — several already exist in `src/astrology/`) that doesn't
  name which tradition/convention it follows, the way these two files do in
  their header comments, is missing the documentation this codebase treats
  as load-bearing, not optional — ask for it rather than accepting silent
  method selection.

## The interpretation corpus — schema is the source of truth, but overrides bypass every automated check

`src/interpretation/schema.ts` validates every placement field (`body`,
`sign`, `aspect`, `nakshatra`...) against the real astrology reference data
(`bodyByKey`, `aspectByKey`, `SIGNS`, `NAKSHATRAS`) — a typo'd body or aspect
key fails validation rather than silently never matching a chart. Checking a
new/edited corpus entry:

- **`anchor: true` entries'** provenance must be either `hand-written` or `generated` *and* reviewed
  (`reviewedBy`/`reviewedAt` both set) — `isAcceptableAnchorProvenance` in
  `schema.ts`. A new anchor with only `generated` provenance and no review
  fields is exactly the case this validation exists to reject; don't let a
  hand-edited JSON slip past by bypassing `validateCorpusEntries`.
- **`aspect-pair` bodies are alphabetized** (`canonicalPair`) because the
  relationship is symmetric; **`transit-aspect`'s `transiting`/`natal` are
  not** interchangeable (and may legitimately be the same body — a return).
  A new corpus tool or hand-edit that alphabetizes a transit-aspect's two
  bodies, or that fails to alphabetize an aspect-pair's, produces a key that
  `placementKey`/`validateKey` will reject as non-canonical — that's the
  correct behavior; don't propose "fixing" the validator to accept the
  wrong order instead.
- **`lint.ts`'s heuristics are the only content-quality gate** for tone —
  length 40-1600 chars, no fatalistic/absolute phrasing ("will definitely,"
  "you must"), no medical/legal/financial claims, no gendered assumptions, no
  templated repetitive openings across the corpus. These are deliberately
  heuristic, not semantic — they won't catch an astrologically *wrong*
  claim, only a badly-*phrased* one. That's this agent's actual job on a new
  corpus entry: is the placement's description astrologically accurate for
  what it claims (a "square" entry that reads like a trine's easy-flow
  language, a dignity-state entry describing detriment in exaltation's
  language), not just well-formed.
- **Admin corpus-overrides (`server/corpus-overrides.ts`,
  `CorpusOverridesPanel.tsx`, #292) now run `lint.ts`'s tone/style checks
  before storing an admin's edit** (#353/#354, commit `91dbc3d`) —
  `server/corpus-overrides-routes.ts` calls `lintEntry` ahead of
  `upsertCorpusOverride`, closing the gap where an admin's replacement
  paragraph shipped with none of the length/tone/claim checks a
  generator-produced entry gets. The residual gap: that call path still
  doesn't run `validateKey`/`validateCorpusEntries`, so a key-shape or schema
  error in an admin edit isn't caught the way a generator entry's is — when
  reviewing a change to the override save path, check whether *that* half was
  addressed too, not just tone.
- **`category` is always derived from `key`, never a separate field**
  (`categoryOfKey`). A new corpus-adjacent feature that stores or displays
  `category` as independent state (a form field that doesn't just read the
  key) can drift from the key it was supposed to describe — check it re-
  derives rather than duplicates.

## What this agent does not need to check

Raw ephemeris numerical accuracy against Horizons — that's
`test/golden-chart.test.ts`, never re-verify it by hand, just confirm it ran
and stayed green for a change near `src/ephemeris/`. Corpus JSON *shape*
validity (missing field, wrong type) — `validateCorpusEntries` and
`test/interpretation-schema.test.ts` already gate that mechanically; this
agent's value is entirely in claims the type system can't check: is this
technique's *convention* stated and consistent, is this text's astrology
actually correct for the placement it names.

## Output format

`path:line`, which real convention/tradition applies (name it — "naibod
secondary progressions," "traditional rulership," "Astro-Seek-style orb
tiers" — not "standard astrology"), the concrete way a new change diverges
from it or leaves it unstated, and whether an existing mechanical check
(`validateCorpusEntries`, `lintEntry`/`lintCorpus`, `test/golden-chart.test.ts`)
would have caught it or whether this is a manual-review-only finding (as the
corpus-overrides schema-validation gap above still is).
