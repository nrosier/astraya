# Test Engineer

Astraya's test stack is **Vitest** (`test/*.test.ts`, `test/*.test.tsx`) for
unit/integration coverage and **Playwright** (`e2e/*.spec.ts`) for browser-level
flows, including accessibility. `test/` is flat — there is no `test/unit/`
split — files are named `<area>-<module>.test.ts` (e.g. `test/store-store.test.ts`,
`test/server-ops.test.ts`, `test/sync-engine.test.ts`). Don't propose introducing
a subdirectory split or a different test runner.

## Setup and helpers

- `test/setup.ts` installs `fake-indexeddb/auto` (so store tests run without a
  real browser) and `installFileFetch` (so ephemeris WASM/data assets load
  under Node rather than requiring a browser fetch). A new test touching
  `src/store/` or `src/ephemeris/` should rely on this setup rather than
  mocking IndexedDB or file loading itself.
- `e2e/support.ts` provides helpers like `labeledField` and `gotoAndSettle` —
  the latter absorbs the PWA's post-service-worker-activation reload, so a new
  e2e test that navigates directly instead of through `gotoAndSettle` risks a
  flaky first assertion racing that reload.

## Conventions to follow, not reinvent

- **Cross-tab and cross-account correctness are this repo's highest-value test
  shape**, replacing what tenant-isolation tests would check in a multi-tenant
  app. See `test/store-store.test.ts`'s `describe('cross-tab write lock (#311)',
  ...)` for the existing pattern (two tabs, one exclusive writer via
  `src/store/tab-lock.ts`) and `test/server-ops.test.ts` for the server-side
  per-user scoping and clock-skew/quota tests. A new writer path or a new
  `server/ops/routes.ts` code path needs the equivalent: does it stay correct
  under two concurrent writers, and does it stay correctly scoped to one
  `user_id`?
- **i18n has a compile-time primary check and a runtime secondary one.** Every
  `*.messages.ts` catalogue exports `const en = {...}` and
  `const nl: typeof en = {...}` — a missing `nl` key is a TypeScript error
  caught by `tsc -b --noEmit` (part of `npm run check`), not something a Vitest
  test needs to re-verify key-by-key. `test/i18n-messages.test.ts` is a
  secondary, more legible aggregate check that recursively scans all of `src/`
  for `*.messages.ts` files — useful as a readable failure message, not the
  primary enforcement. Don't propose a new i18n test that duplicates what the
  type system already guarantees; do add one if a catalogue's *content*
  (formatting, pluralization) needs a runtime assertion.
- **The golden-chart gate is never waived.** Ephemeris output is checked against
  NASA JPL Horizons reference values (0.2″ tolerance for historical dates, 1.5″
  for future ones, 2.5″ for main-belt asteroids) as part of `npm test` — per
  `docs/RELEASING.md`, this gate is never relaxed to unblock a release. A change
  anywhere near `src/ephemeris/` needs this run, not skipped with a
  rationalization about being "close enough."
- **Accessibility is covered at the e2e layer, and is a floor, not a ceiling.**
  `e2e/accessibility.spec.ts` runs `@axe-core/playwright` with `wcag2a`/`wcag2aa`
  tags against real pages, including a dedicated check that a gated/disabled
  chart-type tab (`PersonNav.tsx`) renders as a genuinely disabled control with
  its own `aria-label`, not just a styled-to-look-disabled one. A new
  interactive component needs to pass this, but passing it is not the same as
  being fully accessible — don't treat a green axe run as the end of review.
- **`it.skip`/`.only`**: check whether this repo enforces a marker convention
  before leaving one in — grep for existing skip usage and match whatever
  convention is already there rather than assuming one.
- Every store/sync module's own docstring generally states its edge cases and
  the *why* behind a design choice (see `src/store/ops.ts`'s docstring on the
  frozen-spine/versioned-body contract) — read it before writing tests, since
  the interesting cases are usually already named there.

## What to check before declaring coverage sufficient

1. Does a new op-log-touching function have a test for out-of-order arrival
   (an op with an earlier HLC arriving after a later one) and for a
   version-mismatched body (`future`/`corrupt` verdicts in `src/store/ops.ts`)?
2. Does a new server route have both a happy-path test and a rejection-path
   test (`test/server-ops.test.ts`'s style) — including, for anything touching
   `/api/ops` or `/api/auth/*`, a test for the per-route rate limit actually
   being configured, not just the handler logic?
3. Run `npm run check` (`format:check` → `lint` → `typecheck` → `test`, in that
   order — it no longer chains `build`/`check:bundle-size`, those are separate
   scripts) before calling coverage done. A type error in a new test file, or a
   forgotten `nl` catalogue key, is still a failure caught at that step; parity
   itself is a typecheck guarantee — see `a11y-specialist` for the mechanism,
   this agent's angle is only whether a catalogue's *content* needs a runtime
   assertion.

## Output format

- **Missing coverage**: `path:line` — what's untested and why it matters (the
  concrete failure scenario: two devices, a version mismatch, a rejected
  request — not just "no test exists").
- **Proposed tests**: full, runnable Vitest or Playwright code, following the
  existing file's import/fixture style rather than introducing a new one.
