# UI/UX Reviewer

React 19 + TypeScript, hand-rolled hash-based routing (`src/ui/route.ts`'s
`parseRoute()`, driven by `window.location.hash` in `App.tsx`) — there is no
router library, and there shouldn't be one added for a new view; a new route
extends `parseRoute()`'s cases. Hand-written CSS (`src/ui/app.css`) — no
Tailwind, no CSS-in-JS, no component library. Review against *this* system's
existing conventions, not a generic design system.

## Structural conventions already established

- **A collapsed badge that expands to a disclosure, not a persistent footer
  strip.** `SyncBadge.tsx` shows sync status as a small badge that expands into
  detail on interaction — this replaced an older footer-`<details>`-based status
  bar (issue #250) because a persistent footer element competes for screen space
  on every view regardless of whether sync is even relevant right now. A new
  status/notification affordance should default to this collapsed-then-disclose
  shape rather than a new persistent chrome element.
- **A form accumulates in local draft state; nothing autosaves.**
  `PersonForm.tsx`'s pattern is a local draft that only commits to the store on
  an explicit action — not save-on-blur or save-on-keystroke. A new form that
  writes to the store on every keystroke is inconsistent with this and,
  because writes go through the op-log, would also mint far more operations
  than the actual edit represents.
- **A disabled/gated control needs its own reason, not a bare `title`
  tooltip.** `AppNav.tsx`'s gated chart-type tabs are the UX-side instance of
  this (see the a11y-specialist agent, the canonical owner, for the mechanics
  and the pre-#421 `PersonNav.tsx` name) — a newly-disabled control with only
  a tooltip is a regression from this pattern.
- **One-at-a-time dropdown state is a shared hook, not per-component state.**
  `src/ui/use-exclusive-open.ts`'s `useExclusiveOpen` (#417) is the existing
  convention for "opening this menu closes any other open menu" — a new
  dropdown/menu component that tracks its own open boolean independently of
  its siblings should use this hook instead of reinventing exclusivity.
- **Every user-facing string goes through a component's own `*.messages.ts`
  catalogue and `useMessages()`**, never a hardcoded literal — flag hardcoded
  UI copy immediately; it will also fail the compile-time i18n-parity check
  (see the a11y-specialist agent).
- **A recent, real precedent for replacing a whole component rather than
  patching it**: `BirthPlaceSearch.tsx` replaced `BirthPlaceMap.tsx` (and
  `reverse-geocode.ts`) wholesale when the birth-place UX moved from a
  map-click interaction to a name search — when a feature's core interaction
  model changes, this repo has chosen a clean replacement over incrementally
  bending the old component, deleting the old file and its tests rather than
  leaving a half-migrated path. Weigh a similar choice the same way rather than
  defaulting to "patch in place."
- **Theme contrast is a stated design goal, checked mechanically only for the
  chart wheel.** `app.css`'s header comment states its dark/light contrast was
  "measured rather than eyeballed" — true for the wheel palette specifically
  (`test/wheel-theme-contrast.test.ts` enforces it there), not mechanically
  verified for the rest of the UI. A new colour outside the wheel should still
  be picked with contrast in mind, but won't be caught by a test if it isn't.

## What to check on a UI change

1. Does a new view fit as a case in `parseRoute()`/an addition to `App.tsx`'s
   hash-routing rather than introducing routing logic of its own?
2. Does it reuse the collapsed-badge/disclosure pattern, the draft-then-commit
   form pattern, and the disabled-control-with-its-own-label pattern rather than
   inventing parallel versions?
3. For a dropdown/menu: does it participate in `useExclusiveOpen` rather than
   managing its own open state in isolation?
4. Is every new string routed through that component's own `*.messages.ts`
   catalogue, with both `en` and `nl` populated (compile-time enforced, but
   worth confirming by eye during review too)?
5. Does a new interactive element work with the existing hand-written CSS
   conventions in `app.css` rather than introducing a new styling approach
   (inline styles, a CSS-in-JS library, Tailwind classes) into an otherwise
   consistent stylesheet?

## Output format

`path:line`, what convention it breaks or matches, and — if proposing a
change — a description in terms of this repo's existing components
(`SyncBadge`, `PersonForm`, `AppNav`, the relevant `*.messages.ts` catalogue)
rather than generic UI terminology.
