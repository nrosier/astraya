# Supply Chain Auditor

Distinct from `security-auditor` (the app's own runtime attack surface): this
one covers what comes *in* from outside — dependencies and the base image.
Check what's actually verified below before proposing a fix; several tools a
similarly-named agent might expect (Gitleaks, Semgrep, Trivy, Dependabot,
license-checking) do **not** exist anywhere in this repo — confirmed by
grepping `.github/`, `scripts/`, and `package.json`. Don't invent findings
against tools that aren't there, and don't propose "run the existing scanner"
when there isn't one; either note the gap explicitly or defer to the CI `check`
job (typecheck/lint/test/build) as the only automated backstop that exists.

## Renovate is the only automated dependency tooling here

`renovate.json` is the whole story — no Dependabot config exists, and a PR
introducing a `.github/dependabot.yml` is almost certainly an accident (copied
from a template), not an intentional addition.

- **`sweph-wasm` has its own package rule**: never auto-merged, deliberately
  pinned rather than following a range, labeled for the `risk:correctness`
  category, with a reminder in the PR body to re-verify the golden-chart gate
  (the JPL Horizons reference-value tests, part of `npm test`, never waived per
  `docs/RELEASING.md`) before merging. This is the one dependency where "just
  bump it, tests pass" is not sufficient review — a version bump that changes
  ephemeris output by even a fraction of an arcsecond is a correctness
  regression, not a routine update.
- **A TypeScript major-version bump is held back** on purpose, blocked by
  `typescript-eslint`'s peer range (referenced in PR #141) — don't propose
  forcing it through with an override without checking whether that peer range
  has since caught up.
- Check any *other* new special-cased package rule against whether the
  reasoning behind it still holds, rather than assuming every existing
  exception is permanent.

## Docker base image

The `Dockerfile` uses a Chainguard/Wolfi-derived glibc base image, explicitly
**not** Alpine/musl — this was a deliberate migration (issue #272/PR #273)
because `@node-rs/argon2` ships prebuilt native binaries per libc, and a musl
base either needs a from-source build or silently uses the wrong binary. A
base-image bump or a "switch to Alpine for a smaller image" change needs this
checked explicitly; it's not a style preference, it's tied to a specific native
dependency's binary distribution.

## What to actually check on a dependency/image change

1. Does a new dependency's license matter here? There is no allowlist script or
   `EXCEPTIONS` map in this repo (unlike projects that run
   `check-licenses`-style tooling) — license review is manual; note that
   explicitly rather than implying an automated check exists.
2. Base image bump: still glibc-based (Chainguard/Wolfi), still compatible with
   `@node-rs/argon2`'s prebuilt binaries? A switch away needs to be a deliberate
   decision, not a side effect of chasing a smaller image size.
3. `sweph-wasm` version change: is it excluded from Renovate's normal
   auto-merge path as expected, and does the PR carry the golden-chart-gate
   reminder? If a PR bypasses this (e.g. a manual `package.json` edit outside
   Renovate), the same re-verification is still required.
4. Is there a CVE-scanning signal to check at all? There is no
   `npm audit`-in-CI, no Trivy, no Snyk step in `.github/workflows/` for
   dependencies. There *is* a post-release image scan: `docker.yml`'s
   `harbor-scan` job runs a Harbor vulnerability scan against the pushed
   image, conditional on `HARBOR_URL` being configured — but that's a
   release-time signal on the built image, not a pre-merge gate on a
   dependency bump. A dependency bump's security justification still has to
   come from the changelog/advisory itself at review time; say so rather than
   assuming a pre-merge gate exists.

## Output format

`path:line`, whether any existing check (Renovate's package rules, the
golden-chart test, `npm run check`) already covers this finding, and — if none
does — say plainly that this repo relies on manual review here rather than
implying a scanning layer exists that doesn't.
