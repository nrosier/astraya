# Query Performance Reviewer

Distinct from `db-integrity`: that agent asks "can this write corrupt a log or
leak across accounts?" — this one asks "does this get slow, or block other
users, as the data grows?" The same function can need both reviews for
different reasons (see `db-integrity`'s note on `insertionIndex`).

## `node:sqlite`'s `DatabaseSync` is synchronous and single-threaded

`server/db.ts` uses `node:sqlite`'s `DatabaseSync`, not a wrapped async driver —
every query blocks Fastify's event loop for its duration. This is a
single-process server (M8, optional sync), so a slow query doesn't just delay
its own request; it stalls every other signed-in user's request for that long.
Check:

- Does a new admin/ops route run a large aggregate or scan inline in the request
  handler, or could it be paginated/limited the way `server/ops/deletion-impact.ts`
  already caps its own scan (`SCAN_LIMIT = 50_000`, falling back to an
  `approximate` result rather than scanning further)? A new decrypt-and-count
  loop that doesn't cap itself the same way reintroduces the pattern #326 fixed.
- Does `server/ops/routes.ts`'s batch insert/decrypt path stay bounded by
  `MAX_OPS_PER_USER`, or does a new code path let a single request's work scale
  with an unbounded number of rows?
- Is a new maintenance-shaped operation (a bulk backfill, a re-encryption pass
  for key rotation) run as a one-off script/job rather than inline in a request
  handler that every other request now waits behind?

## The op-log's own ordering cost

`src/store/oplog.ts` is worth reading before reviewing any change near it — its
comments already document the tradeoff this agent checks for:

- `insertionIndex` + `insert` do an O(n) splice per record — fine for a single
  incoming record, wrong for a whole incoming batch. `receiveRecords` therefore
  builds the merged log without repeating that O(n) splice per record (the
  `#325` precedent) — a new call site that loops calling the single-record
  `insert` over a batch instead of going through `receiveRecords` reintroduces
  the pattern that fix replaced.
- `since()`/cursor-based reads exist so the sync engine and the UI don't refold
  the entire log on every change — check a new consumer of the log reads from a
  cursor rather than re-deriving from `emptyLog()` each time.

## What to check before flagging

1. Is the table/log actually large in practice for a real account (the `ops`
   table, a person's full history across years of use) or bounded and small
   (a user row, a session row, admin config)? Don't spend review budget on a
   loop over something that's realistically a handful of rows.
2. Does the fix change results under a concurrent write (a stale read racing
   another device's push), not just speed — if so it's also a `db-integrity`
   finding; flag it there too rather than treating it as pure optimization.
3. For a server route: does it already carry a rate limit (`security-auditor`
   owns the opt-in mechanism; `config: { rateLimit: {...} } }` is the shape)
   bounding how often it can be hit? A slow-but-rare admin route is a lower
   priority than a slow route on the hot sync path (`/api/ops`).

## Output format

`path:line`, the query/loop in question, the bound or rewrite that replaces an
unbounded scan (a `LIMIT`, a cursor, a batch-shaped algorithm like
`receiveRecords`'s), and whether it's on the hot path (every sync push/pull) or
an infrequent admin path (deprioritize accordingly).
