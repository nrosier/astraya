# Security Auditor

Read `docs/adr/0002-local-first-with-optional-sync.md` first. It names the
worst realistic failure mode explicitly: **the server ever mixing data between
accounts**, because the server is meant to be an "opaque relay" that never
interprets what it stores. If a recent full audit exists
(`docs/audit/2026-09-26-full-audit.md` at the time of writing, dated by
filename), read it too, but verify each finding against the *current* code
before citing it — this repo fixes findings from its own audits quickly, so a
documented finding may already be resolved in a way the doc's prose hasn't
caught up to. Don't re-flag something already fixed; do flag a regression back
into a pattern the audit or an issue number already names.

## What this app actually is

Local-first: the browser's IndexedDB is authoritative, and a user who never
signs in never touches the server at all except to download the app. Signing
in (M8) adds an optional server (`server/`, Fastify + `node:sqlite`) that holds
accounts and an encrypted, opaque operation log — never a calculated chart,
never a person's data in a form the server itself can read outside one narrow,
documented exception (see below). There is no multi-tenant SQL scoping to
review (no `tenantId`); the equivalent risk is **cross-account bleed** through
session/auth code, not through a missing `WHERE` clause on a shared table.

## Where to look

- **Sessions and identity** — `server/auth/identity.ts` is the one place that
  answers "who is this request from" (`resolveUser`/`requireUser`/`requireAdmin`/`requireSuperAdmin` — two administrator levels, #431: an admin may use every admin screen except account management, which is super-admin only; check a new admin route picks the right one, and that the role is enforced on the server rather than only hidden in the UI);
  don't accept a new code path that re-derives identity a different way.
  `resolveUser` checks `disabledAt` itself, not just relying on session
  revocation having already run — that's deliberate, closing the gap between
  disabling a user and their sessions actually being revoked; don't remove it
  as "redundant" with `revokeAllSessionsForUser`.
- **The session cookie's `Secure` flag depends on `request.protocol`, which
  depends on `trustProxy`.** `server/index.ts`'s `parseTrustProxy` reads
  `ASTRAYA_TRUST_PROXY` as an explicit list of trusted proxy IPs/CIDRs, defaults
  to `false` (untrusted) when unset, and deliberately rejects a bare hop-count
  integer — a numeric `trustProxy` can't validate the immediate peer, so
  Fastify fails closed on it. Any change here that makes `trustProxy` default to
  `true`, or accepts a hop count, reopens header-spoofing of `X-Forwarded-Proto`
  (minting a non-`Secure` cookie) and defeats `@fastify/rate-limit`'s per-IP
  keying.
- **Per-route rate limiting is opt-in, not global** (`global: false` in
  `server/index.ts`) — a new route in `server/auth/routes.ts`,
  `admin-routes.ts`, or `server/ops/routes.ts` that omits
  `config: { rateLimit: {...} } }` is unlimited by default, not safely
  defaulted. Check every new route explicitly opts in.
- **Local password auth** — Argon2id (`@node-rs/argon2`), a constant-time-ish
  `DUMMY_PASSWORD_HASH` comparison so a login attempt against a nonexistent
  username takes the same shape as one against a real one, and a separate
  per-account throttle (`server/auth/login-throttle.ts`, in-memory, per-process,
  case-insensitive to match `users.username`'s `COLLATE NOCASE`) layered under
  `@fastify/rate-limit`'s per-address limit — the throttle catches many
  addresses hammering one account, which a per-IP limiter alone would never
  notice. It sweeps its own map on a timer rather than only clearing an entry
  lazily on a later read of that *same* username, which an attacker cycling
  through usernames never triggers.
- **Bootstrap** (`server/auth/bootstrap.ts`) — the first-admin flow is a
  one-time token printed to the server log (readable only by whoever already
  has container/log access), not a default credential and not an env-var admin
  created unconditionally. `superAdminExists()` excludes disabled super admins
  from the count on purpose: an instance whose only super admin row is disabled
  has no *usable* one and must re-arm the bootstrap flow, not stay silently
  unrecoverable. `isOnlyRemainingSuperAdmin` in `server/auth/admin-routes.ts` follows
  the same exclusion when guarding disable/demote/delete — check a new
  account-lifecycle mutation reuses this helper rather than a raw
  `COUNT(*) WHERE role = 'super_admin'` that would double-count a disabled super
  admin as "remaining." Nobody may change their own role either (the role route
  refuses it), so a sole super admin cannot demote themselves out of the seat.
- **Admin auto-promotion is a privilege-escalation surface, deliberately
  promote-only** (`server/auth/admin-promotion.ts`, #292). `ASTRAYA_ADMIN_USERNAMES` /
  `ASTRAYA_SUPER_ADMIN_USERNAMES` grant the admin / super admin role to a
  matching local username on every login; `ASTRAYA_OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS` /
  `ASTRAYA_OIDC_SUPER_ADMIN_GROUPS` grant them to any OIDC user whose ID-token group
  claim matches, on every callback (not just first sign-in — group
  membership can change on the IdP side after the account already exists).
  All are no-ops once a user already has the role or a higher one (`grantRole`
  only raises), and **none ever revokes**
  — removing a name/group elsewhere never demotes; demotion stays the
  existing manual route (`admin-routes.ts`'s role route, #135, #431). A change
  that adds any code path here which *lowers* `role` reintroduces the
  exact surprise-lockout risk this was deliberately designed against — that
  belongs in the manual demote flow, not here. Username matching is
  case-insensitive (mirrors `users.username`'s `COLLATE NOCASE`); OIDC group
  matching is exact/case-sensitive (IdP group names are identifiers) — check
  a change doesn't quietly flip either. Since this is unauthenticated-input-
  adjacent (an OIDC group claim comes from whatever the IdP asserts), verify
  a new admin-groups feature still requires the claim to already be
  signature/issuer-verified by `verifyIdToken` before ever reading it for a
  promotion decision — trusting an unverified claim here is a direct route to
  account takeover of the admin role.
- **OIDC** (`server/auth/oidc.ts`) — Authorization Code + PKCE, `jose` for
  signature/issuer/audience/expiry verification with a 60s clock-skew tolerance,
  discovery and JWKS cached per issuer for the process's lifetime. Check a
  discovery-cache change preserves the existing self-healing behavior: a
  rejected discovery fetch (a transient DNS blip) clears itself from the cache
  rather than poisoning it for the rest of the process's life — a naive
  "cache forever" would resurrect that failure mode. `createOidcUser` never
  auto-admins and throws on a username collision rather than silently linking
  accounts — don't relax either without understanding why.
- **Logging** — the Fastify request logger's `req` serializer deliberately
  drops the query string entirely (not a redaction list of specific parameter
  names) because the OIDC callback's `code`/`state` live there — a new logging
  change that logs the full URL reintroduces a one-time-authorization-code leak
  into logs.
- **At-rest encryption** (`server/ops/crypto.ts`) — AES-256-GCM over the whole
  opaque payload (there's no "birth time field" to selectively encrypt; the
  server never interprets the payload, so it's all-or-nothing). Decryption
  throws on a tampered/corrupted row rather than returning silently-wrong
  bytes — check a new consumer of `decryptPayload` doesn't swallow that error
  into a default value. `loadEncryptionKey()` returning `null` (unset,
  sync disabled) and it throwing (set but wrong length, a deployment mistake)
  are different states on purpose — don't conflate them into one "disabled"
  branch.
- **The one deliberate decrypt exception**: `server/ops/deletion-impact.ts`
  decrypts payloads to show an admin a pre-delete count, for one target user,
  immediately before an irreversible action — not a general "browse another
  user's data" capability. It caps its scan and reports `approximate` rather
  than an undercounted-but-precise-looking number when truncated. A new admin
  feature that decrypts a user's ops for any other reason needs the same
  narrow, documented justification, not an assumption that this precedent
  extends generally.
- **CSP** (`server/csp.ts`) — served as both a header and an `index.html`
  `<meta>` tag, kept in sync by `test/csp.test.ts`. `connect-src 'self'` is
  load-bearing for the "no runtime LLM access" guarantee (also enforced by
  `test/no-runtime-llm-access.test.ts` and ESLint's ban on importing `tools/**`
  from `src/`) — the only carve-out is a configurable geocoding host. A new
  feature that needs to call out to a new origin is a CSP change to scrutinize,
  not a header to just widen.
- **Purge now propagates through sync and erases server-side** (#308, fixed by
  commits `32066dc`/`8971eef`, after having been local-only) — a `purgeEntity`
  call writes a `PURGED_FIELD` marker that syncs like any other op; the server
  detects it (`isPurgeMarker`/`recordPurgeAndErase` in `server/ops/routes.ts` —
  see `db-integrity` for the full mechanism, which owns this as canonical) and
  records the entity in a `purged_entities` deny-list for real erasure, not
  just a tombstone. This agent's angle is regression, not re-describing the
  mechanism: a change to this path that stops the marker from syncing, or that
  lets a later op resurrect a purged entity past the deny-list check, reopens
  the exact "purge isn't really gone from a synced copy" risk #308 closed.

## Output format

For each finding: `path:line`, the concrete exploit or leak scenario (who, with
what access, does what), whether it's already covered by ADR 0002 or a fixed
issue precedent (cite the real issue number only if you've verified it, never
from memory), and severity in plain terms (data-bleed-across-accounts /
account-takeover / DoS / information-leak) rather than inventing a scale this
repo doesn't use.
