## [0.33.0] — 2026-10-08

**PDF exports can now include transits and forecast sections, the admin Users table distinguishes real activity from a backgrounded tab, chart tables explain more of their columns on hover, and Tier 2 AI interpretation's daily cost caps are now enforced correctly under concurrent requests.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — v1.0.0 hasn't shipped yet. All of M9's other tracked issues are closed, but #120 (the milestone's own release-tracking issue) stays open: it still needs a verification pass by an astrology practitioner and a deployed-About-page check, which this release does not satisfy on its own.

### Added

- **PDF export gains transits and forecast sections (#441).** Each is a single optional field, like synastry/composite, with its own "as of" date and the "important vs. all" contact filter already offered on screen — chosen explicitly for the export rather than read off whatever the live view happens to show. Both are included in the complete-archive preset.
- **The admin Users table shows who is actually using the app, not just who has a tab open (#445).** "Last seen" updates on any authenticated request, including a background session heartbeat — it doesn't distinguish real use from an idle tab. Two new columns, "Last sync" (a chart actually added or edited) and "Last AI usage" (the paid/metered Tier 2 feature), give a signal that means genuine activity.
- **More table columns explain themselves on hover (#456).** Speed, Retrograde and Aspect in the positions/aspects tables, the fixed-star name column, the derived-point label column, and all eight dignity-state columns in the Dignities table now carry the same tooltip mechanism "applying" already used — the Dignities table previously had no tooltip coverage at all.

### Fixed

- **Tier 2's daily AI-interpretation cost caps are now enforced atomically under concurrency (#461).** The verification and generation calls in one request, or two concurrent requests, could both read the same stale daily-spend total and both pass a check that, combined, exceeded the cap, because spend was only recorded after a provider call returned. Each chargeable call now reserves a conservative worst-case cost inside a database transaction before calling the provider, is visible to any other concurrent request immediately, and is reconciled down to the real cost (or released on failure) once the call completes.
- **The About page no longer claims no AI service is ever contacted (#462).** That was true before Tier 2 AI-customized interpretation shipped and false after: contacted only when a signed-in user explicitly opts in, for that one request. The privacy statement now says so in both locales, with a regression test pinning the exact wording.
- **A superseded birth-place search can no longer overwrite a newer one's results (#463).** Submitting a new search while an older one was still in flight had no cancellation guard, so a slower earlier search could land its results after a faster later one and quietly swap in the wrong coordinates for the chart.
- **The Changelog screen's chrome is translatable (#464).** "Back", "Changelog", "You are running" and "Full commit history" were hardcoded in English, unlike every other screen; they now come from a `Changelog.messages.ts` catalogue in both locales. The changelog text itself still stays in whatever language it was written in.
- **The Dutch-locale e2e test for the About page primer now actually switches locale (#465).** It asserted the English headings under a "renders in Dutch" name without ever clicking the language toggle; it now clicks it and checks against the Dutch strings.
- **A floating-point edge case at exactly 0° latitude no longer forces the quadrant-angle property test's tolerance to keep loosening (#467).** House system APC's cusps-based and Ascendant/Midheaven-based code paths genuinely disagree by several arcminutes, but only within a sub-micrometer band around the equator — not a realistic birth-chart input. The test now excludes that degenerate band for this one house system instead of loosening its tolerance again.
- **19 composite-chart corpus entries that had fallen out of sync between English and Dutch are cross-translated and re-queued for evaluation (#451).** Each locale had a disputed entry the other locale's clean version could translate from; all 19 translations passed language validation.

### Internal tooling

- **The corpus generator's eval-tracking state is restored to a consistent 7328-entry baseline** after a cancelled evaluation batch left it with thousands of entries stuck in a stale re-check state; only the 19 entries actually touched by #451's cross-translation are marked for re-evaluation. None of this touches the shipped corpus content beyond #451's own fix above.
- **A verified CC0 1655 degree-symbol source text (Angelus/Turner) is seeded for #405** as prep material for testing the LLM generator against a real historical source — not yet run through the generator or shipped as corpus content.
- **The abandoned benchmark-dashboard tooling is archived**, superseded by the corpus evaluation/improvement loop already in use.

### Notes for people running their own server

- **New migration 15** adds the `interpretation_cost_reservations` table used by #461's atomic cost-cap check. It runs automatically on next startup; no configuration changes needed.

## [0.32.1] — 2026-10-07

**A patch for v0.32.0: the same app, with its generated-constants check fixed so the release could be published.**

v0.32.0's tagged CI run failed `scripts/gen-constants.mjs --check` — not because any Swiss Ephemeris constant actually changed (still `sweph-wasm 2.6.9`, same 275 numeric / 12 file values), but because an earlier change hand-added a `@module` JSDoc header to the machine-generated `src/ephemeris/generated-constants.ts` without teaching the generator script to emit that header itself, so the generator's own drift check correctly flagged a mismatch between the committed file and what it would produce. The generator now emits the header too; its output is byte-identical to what was already committed. This also means `main`'s own CI had been failing since that earlier change, independent of this release. Nothing about the app's behavior changes between v0.32.0 and this release.

### Fixed

- **The generated-constants drift check passes again.** `scripts/gen-constants.mjs` now emits the `@module` header its own output already carried, so `node scripts/gen-constants.mjs --check` (run by both `main`'s CI and the tagged release workflow) succeeds.

### Notes for people running their own server

- No database migration and no new configuration in this release.

## [0.32.0] — 2026-10-07

**Extended Settings and the Profections rulers selector explain each choice inline as it's made, the About page gains an astrology primer for newcomers, and the Extended Settings Apply button no longer sticks on device-only preference changes.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — v1.0.0 hasn't shipped yet, by deliberate choice: M9's tracked blockers are closed, but 1.0.0 is a separate call about the app being genuinely usable end to end, not a tally of closed issues.

### Added

- **The About page gains an astrology primer for readers unfamiliar with the vocabulary (#457).** A new section introduces chart dimensions, planets/points, zodiac signs, houses, aspects and dignity/rulership in plain language, in both locales.
- **The Extended Settings panel's zodiac/house system, rulership and symbol-class selectors now show a description that updates live with the current selection (#460)**, the same pattern the "Starting Point" selector already used — instead of a static blurb that didn't change when the choice did. Line weight gets its own description, shown only when it's relevant (Drawn symbols). A device-vs-synced "save as default" toggle was prototyped alongside this on a validation page but was not carried into the shipped panel; #460 stays open for that part.
- **Profections' rulers selector explains each choice (traditional/modern/both) as it's picked (#458)**, instead of leaving the reader to infer what the choice means from the chart alone.

### Changed

- **About 230 interpretation texts (119 English, 111 Dutch) were rewritten through the corpus's feedback-review loop**, mostly planet-in-sign and planet-in-house core entries, tightening phrasing and sharpening a number of shadow-side descriptions that had drifted toward generic language. Each rewritten entry carries an `improved-via-feedback-loop` tag in the corpus data; no key, schema or category changed.

### Fixed

- **The Extended Settings "Apply" button no longer stays disabled when only a device preference changed (#459).** Changing symbol class, symbol weight, a glyph variant, or the rulers choice — all stored locally, not in the draft chart settings — didn't register as a change the dirty-state check cared about, so the button stayed disabled even though a change was pending. Rulers and symbol changes now both mark the panel dirty.

### Internal tooling

- **The corpus generator's batch pipeline gets another round of stall/orphan-job handling fixes** (tracking when entry counts actually changed rather than when they were last checked, detecting and resetting orphaned jobs), and its one-off dev scripts have been archived with `--help` documented on the ones that remain. None of this touches the shipped app or server.
- **Every major source directory now has a fast-lookup index, and every source file a standard header,** as an aid for future changes rather than a behavior change: a `MAP.md` per directory and a `@module` JSDoc block (`@purpose`/`@conventions`/`@exports`) on every `.ts`/`.js` file.

### Notes for people running their own server

- No database migration and no new configuration in this release.

## [0.31.1] — 2026-10-06

**A patch for v0.31.0: the same app, with its flaky property test fixed so the release could be published.**

v0.31.0's Docker image and demo build went out as published (its own full check suite passed locally before the tag was pushed), but the tagged CI run's "Verify before publishing" step hit a property test whose counterexample fell a hair outside its assertion's tolerance — a known recurring class of flakiness in this suite, not a real chart defect — so the GitHub Release for v0.31.0 was never created. Nothing in the app changes between v0.31.0 and this release; if you pulled `niqck/astraya:latest` or `:0.31.0` already, nothing about it was wrong.

### Fixed

- **The quadrant-house-system property test (#37) no longer sits at the edge of its own tolerance.** It checks that `cusps[1]`/`cusps[10]` agree with the Ascendant/Midheaven as computed by a separate code path, and has been tightened and defeated by a new counterexample several times before (9, then 8, 7, 6 and 5 decimal places), each time by a margin a hair over whatever threshold was current — the two code paths' disagreement scales with the input rather than being bounded noise around one fixed size. It's now asserted directly in arcseconds, with real headroom, well inside the golden-chart gate's own 0.2″ accuracy claim rather than creeping up on it one decimal place at a time.

## [0.31.0] — 2026-10-06

**Composite charts gain their own interpretation categories and a (still unevaluated) draft corpus, Dispositors becomes easier to find and reads correctly in PDF exports, and chart tables get contextual help tooltips.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — v1.0.0 hasn't shipped yet.

### Added

- **Composite charts have their own corpus categories, not natal ones borrowed for two people (#451).** The generator, schema and report composer gain dedicated `composite-aspect-pair`, `composite-point-in-sign` and `composite-point-in-house` keys, so a composite reading describes the synthetic midpoint chart on its own terms instead of reusing natal wording.
- **A complete composite-chart corpus ships for both locales** — over 1000 aspect-pair entries plus point-in-sign/house entries each. **This batch is unevaluated**: it has no hand-written anchors and has not been through the two-model judge/revise review loop every other shipped corpus entry goes through, so its tone and specificity have not been checked to the usual bar. Treat composite interpretation text as a draft until a reviewed pass replaces it; a near-duplicate pass already caught and rewrote four Dutch entries that had collapsed onto nearly identical template language.
- **Chart tables explain themselves on hover (#456).** The Declinations and Antiscia table headers and the Aspects table's new columns now carry a tooltip explaining what the column means, for a reader who doesn't already know the convention.
- **Dispositors is easier to find (#446).** The table gets its own section heading, a hover tooltip, and a short explanatory paragraph above it describing what a dispositor is and why the chain matters, instead of appearing as an unlabelled table a reader could miss.

### Fixed

- **The dispositor chain's arrow (→) no longer renders as corrupted text in the PDF export (#447).** The PDF builder was stringifying the table's React render output instead of its plain-text value; it now uses the dedicated text value everywhere a PDF needs one, matching what the live table shows.

### Internal tooling

- **The corpus generator's batch pipeline handles failures gracefully instead of crashing or leaving stuck state**, after several rounds of fixes: a failed OpenAI batch is discarded and its entries reset to pending rather than silently stuck, the feedback file stays valid JSON even after a failure partway through, and a new `recover-batch` tool can resume a batch left in a bad state. None of this touches the shipped app or server.
- **A new MCP server, astraya-linter,** exposes the corpus's own lint/schema/locale-parity checks for in-flight validation while drafting corpus text, re-exporting the same rules the app already enforces rather than duplicating them. Build-time tooling only, with a new devDependency to support it.

### Notes for people running their own server

- No database migration and no new configuration in this release.

## [0.30.0] — 2026-10-06

**A grouped relationship summary with house overlays for synastry, a guarded Tier 2 "relationship" reading for a pair of charts, synastry and composite in the PDF export builder, and bi-wheel rings told apart by line style, name and click-to-isolate rather than colour alone.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — v1.0.0 hasn't shipped yet.

### Added

- **A relationship summary for synastry, with a guarded AI-customised reading (#422).** The Synastry screen now shows a themed, ranked panel between the bi-wheel and the aspects table: every cross-chart aspect grouped by what it's about (emotional bond, attraction, communication, commitment, growth, identity, and contacts to the angles) with the strongest contacts first, plus house overlays (each person's planets read into the other's houses, both directions, skipped for a partner with an unknown birth time). None of this needs an LLM — it is written, reviewed corpus text, resolved the same way the natal report already is. A new opt-in "relationship" mode on Tier 2 can additionally read both charts' positions, their cross-aspects and the house overlays — never names, birth dates or places — and write a fuller reading, under its own guardrails: no verdict on whether the relationship will last, no asymmetric blame, no compatibility "score". Consent is spent per request, same as every other Tier 2 panel. The relationship summary is also now a section in the PDF export builder's Synastry options, included by default.
- **Synastry and composite in the PDF export builder (#441).** The builder's chart-type list grows two more: synastry (the bi-wheel plus the ranked, interpreted cross-chart aspects table) and composite (the synthetic midpoint chart), each with its own partner picked on the Export page itself rather than read off a screen left open elsewhere.
- **Bi-wheel rings are told apart by more than colour (#448).** A second or third ring's Ascendant/Midheaven spoke now carries its own dash pattern (ring one dotted, ring two dash-dot) as well as its own colour, and the corner legend shows a short line sample in that style instead of a flat colour dot — so the distinction survives for a colour-blind reader or a black-and-white printout. Synastry's legend also names which ring is the outer and which the inner circle directly. Clicking a ring's legend entry now isolates everything on that ring — its bodies and every aspect, own or cross-ring, touching one of them — the same selection/dimming behaviour a planet or sign click already has.

### Fixed

- **A composite chart's written report no longer reads as if about a third person (#450).** It now opens with a framing paragraph explaining that the chart synthesizes two people's own charts and describes their combination, before the usual placement-by-placement text.
- **Tier 2's freeform mode knows when it's reading a composite chart, not a natal one (#454).** Its system instruction no longer says "a natal chart" unconditionally, and the composite screen now tells it which kind of chart the facts came from.
- **A tool page (cycles, eclipses, horary, electional, rectification) remembers the last person you had open (#453),** instead of dropping the person menu from navigation the moment you leave a person-scoped screen.
- **Free-text table and card content wraps instead of overflowing (#447, #449):** the astrocartography meanings cards and synastry's Interpretation column both now wrap long text within their own width rather than forcing the layout wider.
- **The PDF export's chart wheel no longer runs past the page, and its astrological glyphs draw correctly instead of silently becoming the wrong character (#446).**
- **The PDF builder's standalone-export multi-wheel uses the same ring colours as the live app, and a multi-wheel chart's second and third ring (and the aspects crossing between rings) get their own distinct look (#448)** — the fixes underlying this release's ring-distinction feature above.

### Notes for people running their own server

- No database migration and no new configuration in this release.

## [0.29.0] — 2026-10-05

**A PDF export builder for custom reports, Extended settings regrouped into one card with Apply/Cancel, bold and fine symbol weights, and a tidier admin and navigation.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — v1.0.0 hasn't shipped yet.

### Added

- **A PDF export builder (#441).** A new Export page (reached from the header's Export menu, "Build custom PDF…") where you pick a person, start from a preset (Executive summary, Complete archive, or Custom) and tick exactly what goes in: the birth record, the written interpretation (with an optional AI-customised narrative, its own one-time consent per ADR 0003), and any of the Charts page's five chart types, each with its own wheel/table and parameters (harmonic number, return year or date) chosen on the page itself rather than read off a screen you had open. The result is a real multi-page PDF — vector chart wheels, proper tables, a cover page and a table of contents with real page numbers — built in the browser, with the PDF libraries only loaded once you click Build PDF so they add nothing to the normal app's download. Synastry, composite, transits, forecast, progressions, solar arc, profections, astrocartography and the horary/electional/rectification tools are not in this first slice.
- **A line weight for drawn symbols, and a quick text-only toggle (#419).** Extended settings gains a Symbol weight choice (fine, regular, bold) for the drawn glyph set, and the header now has a one-press button to switch between drawn symbols and text-only (SUN, MOO, ARI, …) for a reader who needs plain text on an unfamiliar device.

### Changed

- **Extended settings is now a single card (#442).** The settings button summarises only what differs from the defaults and opens a modal with Apply and Cancel — it stays usable while a chart is loading or has failed, and nothing changes until you press Apply. Options are grouped by what you're actually setting up (zodiac and houses; bodies and points; aspects and orbs, with the orbs in force spelled out; wheel colours; device preferences), and a Modern Western / Traditional / Hellenistic / Vedic starting point fills the whole profile in one go. The card keeps the wheel's selection and is hidden when printing.
- **The admin corpus tables show the full entry text,** split into Entry, Details and Actions columns, instead of truncating it.

### Fixed

- **The Admin link no longer appears twice (#443).** It stayed in the header's main navigation menu after moving to the account area on the top bar; the duplicate menu entry is removed.

### Notes for people running their own server

- No database migration and no new configuration in this release. The PDF export builder runs entirely in the browser; the server is not involved.

## [0.28.0] — 2026-10-05

**One Charts page for every chart cast for a person, with solar and lunar returns; Export moves into the header; Uranus and Pluto can be drawn in two ways; and about a hundred interpretation texts were rewritten to be more specific.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — v1.0.0 hasn't shipped yet.

### Added

- **A Charts page (#440).** The natal, draconic and harmonic charts used to be separate screens showing the same tables. They are now one page with a chart-type selector at the top, and the sections (chart wheel, chart shape, positions, houses, aspects, dignities, derived points) as tabs on it. The type and the section are in the address, so each view can be linked, and the old draconic and harmonic links still land on it. In the header the **Charts** menu replaces the Natal chart tab and the Chart Variants menu.
- **Solar and lunar returns (#440).** Two new chart types on that page, cast as full charts with the wheel, shape and every table. A solar return takes a year; a lunar return finds the first Moon return on or after a date. Either is cast for the birthplace or for another latitude and longitude (a relocated return), and a table lists its contacts to the natal chart. They share the natal chart's Extended settings (house system, zodiac, orbs, points shown).
- **Export in the header.** One **Export** menu: everything as a single file (every person with their birth record and natal chart tables), the people as a spreadsheet, and the open chart's own exports (SVG, PNG in three sizes, PDF). The buttons that sat under the wheel are gone. The header navigation is also centred now.
- **Two forms of Uranus and Pluto (#419).** In the chart's Extended settings: Uranus as the H with a ball (as before) or the astronomical circle, dot and arrow; Pluto as the orb over a crescent and cross (as before) or the PL monogram. The choice is kept on this device and applies to the wheel, the grids, the diagrams, the tables and the exports. Chiron, Lilith and the nodes have no second form yet because none could be sourced.

### Changed

- About 130 interpretation texts were rewritten in English and Dutch: every dignity entry (rulership, exaltation, detriment, fall) and a few house, cusp, profection and line entries. The generator now knows which sign a dignity is about (Jupiter in exaltation is Cancer) and what a house or angle means, and the judge that reviews the text reads the same facts. The judge also now votes three times and only flags an entry when most votes do. Some texts the judge kept disputing are now settled.

### Notes for people running their own server

- No database migration and no new configuration in this release.
- The "everything" export is a new file format (astraya-export, version 1). It is written only by the browser; the server does not read it.

## [0.27.0] — 2026-10-04

**The navigation moves into the sticky header, with a Tools menu and a Menu button for phones; the chart's tables share the wheel's selection; and symbols can be drawn, written in Unicode or shown as text.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — v1.0.0 hasn't shipped yet.

### Added

- **The menus are in the header (#421).** A person's name and their tabs (Birth record, Natal chart, Interpretation, Astrocartography and the four grouped menus) now sit in the sticky header instead of a bordered strip above the page, so they stay in view while you scroll. Admin is there for administrators. On a phone the whole navigation folds behind a **Menu** button and opens as a panel; choosing anything, pressing Escape or changing page closes it.
- **A Tools menu (#421).** The screens that are not about one person's chart — Planetary cycles, Eclipses, Horary chart, Electional search and Birth-time rectification — were links under the People list. They are now one **Tools** (Dutch _Hulpmiddelen_) menu in the header, on every screen.
- **The tables and the wheel select each other (#418).** On a chart, a **Show** button on a row of the Positions or Aspects table selects that planet or aspect on the wheel, and clicking the wheel marks the matching row. The tables show what is selected and take you to the chart.
- **Choose how symbols are written (#419).** A new **Symbols** setting in the chart's Extended settings: the drawn glyphs (the default, unchanged), Unicode characters (☉ ☽ ♈ ☌), or text only (SUN, MOO, ARI, SQR). It applies to the wheel, the transit and synastry wheels, the aspect grid and diagrams, the Positions table and the exported SVG, and is remembered on this device. Per-symbol variants and further drawn styles are not part of this release.

### Fixed

- The Birth record form no longer scrolls the page sideways on a phone.
- The test suite no longer logs hundreds of "not configured to support act(...)" lines; it now tells React it is a test environment.

## [0.26.1] — 2026-10-04

**A patch that ships the regenerated interpretation text: the Uranus, Neptune and Pluto dignity entries and the rewritten quintile series.**

### Fixed

- **An outer planet in its own sign or detriment now reads reviewed text.** Since the rulership choice (v0.24.0) the app uses Uranus, Neptune and Pluto as rulers of Aquarius, Pisces and Scorpio, but the corpus had no text for those states, so they showed the plain mechanical sentence. The twelve missing entries (ruler and detriment, in English and Dutch) are now in the corpus.
- **Quintile and biquintile interpretations read less generic.** All 744 entries of each language were rewritten with guidance on what is distinctive about that aspect family, a knack for creative synthesis rather than tension or flow. A small remainder the two reviewing models still disagree about is tracked for a later pass.

## [0.26.0] — 2026-10-04

**The natal chart split into sections with an explained chart shape, two administrator levels, one reference for the corpus keys, and the advisor voices removed.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — v1.0.0 hasn't shipped yet.

### Added

- **The natal chart in sections (#430).** One tab strip: Chart (the wheel, opened first), Chart shape, Positions, Houses, Aspects, Dignities and Derived points, each panel under its own heading. The wheel keeps your selection while you visit the tables, the PDF export prints every section in order, and a chart without a birth time shows only the sections it can. **Chart shape** is new: the diagram, an English and Dutch explanation of each shape worded as a convention (Marc Edmund Jones, 1941) rather than a verdict, the Moon phase and the sect.
- **Two administrator levels (#431).** An **admin** can use every admin screen — the user list read-only with each account's role, AI usage and the corpus screens — but cannot create, change or delete accounts. A **super admin** can do everything, including granting roles. It is enforced on the server on every route; nobody can change their own role and the last usable super admin cannot be demoted, disabled or deleted. OIDC groups and local usernames can name either role (`ASTRAYA_OIDC_SUPER_ADMIN_GROUPS`, `ASTRAYA_SUPER_ADMIN_USERNAMES`).
- **What the profected houses and astrocartography lines mean (#427).** The Profections screen explains the profected year and month house, and the Astrocartography screen explains each checked body on each checked line, from the reviewed corpus text.
- **A corpus key reference and audit (#427).** `docs/CORPUS_KEYS.html` lists every key shape and its ordering; `npm run corpus:audit` checks the corpus for valid keys, duplicates, English/Dutch parity, coverage and a shifted sign or house index.

### Changed

- **The advisor voices are gone (#429).** Tone and style are the AI-customised interpretation's job. The picker, its build flag and the saved preference are removed, and so is the voice dimension of the corpus, the corrections and candidates, and the corpus tooling.
- **The chart shape uses the ten planets (#430).** Jones's shapes are drawn from the Sun and Moon through Pluto, so a node, Lilith or an asteroid no longer changes the shape, and the written report and the chart screen now agree. The report's "Your chart forms a … pattern" sentence can change for a chart where an extra point decided the shape.
- **Synastry texts are stored once per pair (#427),** in alphabetical order and written from the first body's owner, which is what the corpus always held; the schema now says so.

### For people running their own server

- **Migration 13** deletes corrections and candidates that were saved for a particular advisor voice and keeps the neutral ones, which are what every reader sees. **Migration 14** replaces the admin flag with a role: every existing admin becomes a **super admin**, so nobody loses access.
- **Usernames on the admin list now become admins, not full administrators.** `ASTRAYA_ADMIN_USERNAMES` is that list; an owner who must manage accounts belongs in the new `ASTRAYA_SUPER_ADMIN_USERNAMES`. The README and `.env.example` describe both lists and the OIDC group variables.
- `VITE_ENABLE_REPORT_PERSONAS` no longer has any effect and can be removed.

## [0.25.0] — 2026-10-04

**A sticky header, readable admin screens, a clickable cycles diagram, synastry contacts ranked by importance, and AI interpretations that say what they were based on.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — v1.0.0 hasn't shipped yet.

### Added

- **One sticky header (#421).** The account, sync status, language and theme sit in a single bar that stays visible while you scroll, with a "skip to content" link. The account popover opens below its button and fits a phone screen.
- **Synastry contacts ranked by importance (#422).** The contacts between two charts are ordered by how much they weigh (the bodies involved, the kind of aspect and how tight it is) with an Importance column from 0 to 100, so the contacts that matter come first.
- **The cycles diagram and its table select each other (#418).** Click a point on a planetary cycle's diagram to highlight its row in the table, or a row to highlight the point; the selection dims the rest and says which step is shown.
- **AI interpretations say what they were based on (#423).** Each saved AI interpretation records its kind and basis — the entire chart, a single body with its natal or transit perspective, or the placements a restyle used — and the history says so, for example "AI interpretation of Mars (natal)". It shows on the Interpretation page's past interpretations and now also under a selected body's own interpretation button, which lists that body's earlier readings and reopens them. Entries from before this say the basis was not recorded. A new kind of AI interpretation must declare its kind and wording in English and Dutch before it can ship.
- **The admin corpus screens speak in words (#428).** Each entry shows what it means ("Sun in the 3rd house", "Zon in het 3e huis") with its key as small secondary text, searchable and sortable by meaning. Category, tier and tags are explained in plain language in English and Dutch instead of internal values, and the tables wrap to the page width instead of scrolling sideways.

### Fixed

- **Long body names no longer overlap in the aspect matrix (#432).** Mean Node and the Lilith variants use short names (_Node (m)_, _Lilith (m)_, in Dutch _Knoop (g)_, _Lilith (g)_), and any name that still would not fit is scaled to its column.

### For people running their own server

- A new database migration (12) adds two plain columns, `kind` and `basis_json`, to the saved AI interpretations. It runs on start and needs no action; older entries are left as they were.
- The Docker image gained one more copied source file (the shared kind-and-basis definitions); `npm run docker:smoke` and the runtime-files test cover it.

## [0.24.1] — 2026-10-04

**A patch for v0.24.0: the same app, with its Docker image fixed so it starts.**

v0.24.0's Docker image crashed on start. The server had gained imports of two shared source files that the image did not contain, and spelled their own imports in a way that the image's Node cannot resolve, so the `0.24.0` and `latest` tags pointed at an image that never became healthy. The app itself, the GitHub release and the demo were not affected. If you run the image, pull `0.24.1`.

### Fixed

- **The Docker image starts again.** The two missing files are copied in and the imports are spelled the way Node needs.
- **A test now computes everything the server loads at runtime and fails if the Dockerfile does not copy it,** or if an import would not resolve in the image, so a new server import cannot reach a release without its line. `npm run docker:smoke` builds the image locally and starts it the way the release workflow does, and is now a step in the release checklist.
- **Two tests that failed at release time are fixed.** One read a generated, gitignored corpus folder instead of the committed corpus, and one compared two ephemeris values to a tolerance that sat exactly on floating-point noise (now 0.018 arcseconds, far inside the 0.2 arcsecond golden-chart gate).

## [0.24.0] — 2026-10-04

**Five new timing and judgment tools (eclipses, horary, electional, rectification, planetary cycles), the transit list now leads with the transits that matter, every wheel can be clicked to isolate and read, the planetary rulers are yours to choose, and AI interpretations are named, labelled and can explain one placement.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — v1.0.0 hasn't shipped yet.

### Added

- **An eclipse finder (#404).** Solar and lunar eclipses for a range of years, with the kind, the exact moment and the zodiac degree each falls at. Pick a person and it shows which of their natal points an eclipse touches, within 3° of the eclipse degree or of the degree opposite it. Checked against NASA's eclipse catalogue for 2023–2026.
- **Horary charts (#406).** A chart cast for the moment a question is asked, with the four classical considerations before judgment stated plainly rather than hidden: the Ascendant in the first or last 3° of its sign, a void-of-course Moon, the Moon in the Via Combusta and Saturn in the 7th house.
- **An electional search (#409).** Searches a window of time for the best moments to begin something and ranks them by how many of the rules you select hold: the Moon not void of course, not in the Via Combusta, not weak and waxing, Mercury direct, a benefic (Venus or Jupiter) in an angular house, and the Moon applying to a benefic. Consecutive moments with the same outcome are merged into windows, and each rule says where it comes from.
- **Birth-time rectification (#408).** Tests candidate birth times against the dates of known life events (solar-arc directions and slow-planet transits to the angles) and ranks them. It narrows a guess; it does not prove one, and each result carries its lift over the average candidate so a flat field is visible.
- **Planetary cycles (#410).** Exact aspects between two moving planets, for example the Jupiter–Saturn conjunctions or the Venus cycle that draws a pentagram, with a diagram and a table. Checked against the known Jupiter–Saturn conjunctions from 1980 to 2040.
- **The interpretation for whatever you click on the natal wheel (#415).** Select a planet, sign or aspect line and the same written interpretation the Interpretation tab shows for it appears under the facts, in your language and chosen advisor voice.
- **Click-to-isolate on the Transits and Synastry bi-wheels (#418).** Each ring draws the same planets, so a click picks out the planet on its own ring (the transiting Sun is not the natal Sun), dims the rest and names the ring in a panel with its sign, house, and aspects to the other ring. The natal wheel now uses the same shared code. The planetary-cycles and chart-shape diagrams cannot be clicked yet.
- **Important transits first (#416).** The Transits screen opens on the transits that matter for a day (the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars within 1.5°, the slow planets only within 1°) and the Forecast screen on those that matter for a year (Jupiter to Pluto and Chiron within 3.5°), ranked by importance. A filter lets you choose a preset, the orb, hard, soft and minor aspects, applying only and individual bodies, and a bar says how many of the total are shown, with a Show all button. The wheel's lines match the table, and your choice is remembered on this device. Transits now also calculate the semisquare, sesquiquadrate and quincunx so the minor aspects can be shown. Contacts to the angles are not covered yet.
- **Choose the planetary rulers (#426).** Modern (Pluto, Uranus and Neptune rule Scorpio, Aquarius and Pisces), Traditional, or Both as co-rulers, kept on this device. The choice drives the chart ruler, the houses a planet rules, essential dignities, dispositors and mutual reception, the almuten, profections (both lords under Both), the transit ranking and the AI interpretation, and can be changed from the chart's extended settings, the transit filter, profections and the report.
- **An AI interpretation of one placement (#424).** Under the information card of a selected planet, on the natal chart and on the Transits wheel, a button asks the model for the tensions of that placement. Only that planet's sign, house, rulerships and aspects are sent, never your name or birth data, and you consent to each request.
- **Past AI interpretations are labelled (#423).** Each carries a few-word description of what you asked, your local time written out (Tuesday March 10 2026 @ 17:30, or the Dutch equivalent) and which kind it was.
- **Reviewed corpus text on the Synastry screen (#422).** The aspect table now shows the written interpretation for each pair of planets, in English and Dutch. The text is written from one person's side, so each is led by whose side it speaks from.

### Changed

- **The planetary rulers are now modern by default (#426).** Before, the dignity tables, dispositors and report used traditional rulers, so a Scorpio, Aquarius or Pisces Ascendant could show two different chart rulers. Under modern, Mars in Scorpio is no longer shown as ruling, and Pluto, Uranus and Neptune can be shown in rulership or detriment. Choose Traditional to get the old behaviour back. The corpus has no written text yet for those outer-planet dignities, so they show a plain mechanical sentence for now.
- **The two AI-written modes are now one (#425).** The mode list offers Restyle reviewed text and AI-written from your full chart; your style, tone and focus instruction is optional in the second, and with none you get a balanced reading of the whole chart. Past interpretations are named Local interpretation based or AI interpretation based instead of by their internal mode.
- **The birth form asks how the time is known before it asks for the time (#420).** While the time is unknown the time field stays visible but dimmed, with the reason beside it.

### Fixed

- **Person-menu dropdowns close (#417)** when you choose an item, click elsewhere, press Escape or tab out, and only one is open at a time.

### Notes for people running their own server

- A database migration (11) adds two nullable columns for the short descriptions of AI interpretations; it applies on start-up and existing entries are unaffected.
- The AI features still need `ASTRAYA_INTERPRETATION_API_KEY` and, to save past interpretations, `ASTRAYA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

## [0.23.1] — 2026-10-03

**A patch for v0.23.0: the same app, with its changelog entry corrected so the release could be published.**

v0.23.0's changelog entry had a formatting slip (a code span inside bold text) that the changelog-rendering test rightly rejected, so its GitHub release was never created even though its Docker image and demo went out. Nothing in the app itself changes; this release is the first to carry the corrected entry.

### Fixed

- **The v0.23.0 changelog entry renders cleanly on the Changelog page** — one bullet showed raw backticks.
- **The end-to-end test for click-to-isolate (#400) selects the clickable glyph group** rather than every element tagged with the planet, which since the wheel redesign (#412) includes its degree stack and tick. The suite is green again.

## [0.23.0] — 2026-10-03

**The natal wheel and aspect grid are rebuilt in the classic Astro-Seek/Astrodienst layout, every wheel symbol is now reliably clickable, an Admin area joins the main menu, and Tier-2 custom prompts are checked by a model before anything is generated.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — v1.0.0 hasn't shipped yet.

### Added

- **A restructured natal wheel (#412).** Outside in: a zodiac dial with the signs coloured by element, a degree ruler hanging inward, a wide planet band where each planet is a radial stack (glyph with an `R` when retrograde, degree, sign, minutes) that moves with its glyph so crowded planets no longer lose their label, and a narrow house dial holding the house numbers, ASC/DSC/MC/IC labels and a tick at each planet's true degree. The four angles run out to the edge with their exact degree printed in the zodiac dial rather than cutting across the aspect web, and aspects within 1° are drawn heavier.
- **Click-to-isolate now works on every planet, sign and aspect line (#412).** Each has an invisible hit area the size of the whole symbol (a 10px-wide strip for a line), so you no longer have to click exactly on a stroke. Signs are clickable too, isolating the sign, the planets in it and their aspects. Everything not involved fades — including other planets' degrees, signs and ticks — and a pointer cursor, hover highlight and a hint line say what can be clicked.
- **An Astro-Seek-style aspect grid (#413).** A positions table (glyph, name, degree, element-coloured sign, minutes, house) sits beside the grid; the Ascendant and Midheaven are rows with their own aspects; each cell shows the aspect glyph with the signed whole-degree orb over `a` (applying) or `s` (separating); aspects within 1° of exact get a heavy border; and the element/modality table moves into the empty corner of the staircase.
- **The Moon's phase on the Positions tab (#403).** One of Rudhyar's eight phases, the Moon's elongation from the Sun to the minute, waxing or waning, and how much of the disk is lit — for example "Last Quarter Moon — 272°57′ ahead of the Sun, waning, 47% lit".
- **Void-of-course Moon on the Transits screen (#402).** For the chosen date it states whether the Moon has made its last major aspect (to the Sun or Mercury–Pluto) before leaving its sign, since when and until when, or what its next aspect is. Times are exact to the minute and given in UTC.
- **An Admin tab in the main menu (#414).** Admins get one tab strip — Users, AI usage, Corpus overrides, Corpus candidates — on every admin screen, and an Admin tab at the end of the person menu. AI usage is now its own screen.
- **Tier-2 custom prompts are checked before anything is generated (#411).** A separate model call judges the instruction and answers `pass` or `fail: <reason>`; only tone, style and focus are allowed, and requests to lie, invent facts or promise outcomes are rejected with the reason shown. A failed or unreadable check blocks generation rather than skipping it. The check is billed against the usage caps like any other call.
- **OIDC admin-group promotion now explains itself (#414).** Each sign-in logs the groups the token carried and whether any matched, with a warning when admin groups are configured but the token has none; start-up states which groups promote. The README and `.env.example` now say the server reads only its process environment, not a `.env` file by itself, and what the Authentik side must provide.

### Changed

- **The Tier-2 mode choice is a dropdown with a one-line description of the selected mode, replacing the three radio buttons (#411).**
- **The corner pill that opened the user list is now "Admin" (#414), and the user list no longer carries the AI-usage table or the corpus links** — both live on the new admin tab strip.
- **The aspect grid's orb is now the signed distance from exact (-3 means three degrees short), with applying or separating shown separately as a or s (#413).** It used to print a minus or plus for applying or separating, with degrees and minutes. The exact orb is still in the Aspects table.
- **Evaluation-loop state for the corpus tooling is now committed** (`tools/corpus-gen/eval-tracking/`), so the review loop's memory of which entries were already judged clean survives a fresh checkout.

## [0.22.0] — 2026-10-03

**A natal-chart feature pass lands most of #398's remaining "computed but no UI"
astrology modules, plus click-to-isolate on the chart wheel, a Jones chart-shape
diagram, and a third Tier-2 interpretation mode.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — v1.0.0 hasn't shipped yet.

### Added

- **The natal chart surfaces five astrology modules that were computed but had no UI consumer (#398).** The Dignities table gains triplicity/bound/face/almuten columns and an Almuten-of-the-Ascendant line, plus anaretic-degree and out-of-bounds badges on Positions; three new tables land — Dispositors, Declinations (parallel/contraparallel), and Antiscia — alongside a Fixed Stars conjunction table (the seven traditionally significant stars) and a plain-text Jones chart-shape line.
- **New Progressions, Solar Arc, and Draconic chart views, plus a planetary-return picker (#398).** Secondary/tertiary/minor progressions share one view with technique and MC-method selectors; Solar Arc directions get their own view; Draconic re-measures every body from the natal North Node; the existing Forecast screen gains a Jupiter/Saturn/Mars/Venus/Mercury return picker alongside the always-on solar/lunar tiers.
- **Click-to-isolate on the natal chart wheel (#400).** Clicking a body glyph or an aspect line dims everything else and opens a focused-info panel with that body's or aspect's detail; clicking the same target again, or empty space, clears it. Scoped to the Natal Chart wheel for this first pass.
- **A visual Jones chart-shape diagram next to the new text label (#401).** A small circular diagram drawn from the person's actual body longitudes, one wedge per occupied cluster, with a Bucket's handle marked in a distinct colour.
- **The regenerated en/nl interpretation corpus ships** — 4796 entries each, en 99.6% / nl 98.9% validated, both above the 98% shipping bar.
- **AI-Customized interpretation (Tier 2) gains a third mode, whole-chart synthesis, alongside grounded and freeform.** Also added: a guardrail against off-topic ("erase the disk") and fabrication ("it doesn't need to be accurate") requests in the custom-prompt field; successful generations are now saved, encrypted at rest, so they can be reopened later without calling the model again; and an admin-only usage/cost view showing per-user and deployment-wide spend against the two daily caps.
- **Interpolated Lilith joins Mean and True as a third selectable Lilith variant.**
- **A one-placement-at-a-time disclaimer** now shows once per Interpretation screen, noting that no single position or aspect carries much weight read in isolation.
- **An admin screen for bulk-triaging generated corpus candidates.** Candidates sit invisible to readers until an admin accepts or rejects them, individually or in batch, sorted worst-triage-score-first.
- **corpus-gen tooling gains a two-model review loop:** an independent judge (ChatGPT) flags entries against each placement's facts and a generic-trope/extreme-shadow failure mode, and the original generator (Gemini) critically reviews — not blindly applies — the judge's concerns before revising. Comes with cross-round rejection memory, cost reporting across every corpus-gen script, a placement-aware generation prompt (about 45% smaller), and a `corpus-stats.mjs` snapshot of how far the loop has progressed.

### Changed

- **The corner chrome is now a top-right locale bar (language, theme) and a bottom-left account bar (sign-in, sync status, ephemeris status), replacing the single top-right sidebar, and the content shell is widened from 46rem to 64rem.**
- **Person tabs are grouped into collapsible families** — Transits & Forecast, Progressions & Directions, Relationship Charts, and Chart Variants — so the tab bar stops growing linearly as more techniques are added. Astrocartography stays standalone.

### Fixed

- **Three overlap/consistency bugs found by a UX/UI review:** the person-tab row could scroll underneath the fixed locale bar on narrow and medium viewports; the PWA update/ephemeris-warming banner could visually cover and intercept clicks on the account bar; and several `<select>` elements (Progressions, the new return picker) were unstyled because they weren't wrapped in the app's field-grid convention.
- **i18n:** sign, body, and aspect names were leaking raw English into the Dutch UI in several places the earlier audit missed — the Forecast screen's Ascendant-sign mentions and transit-aspect sentences, Astrocartography's body picker and relocated-angle labels, and the extended-settings minor-aspects checklist.
- **The OIDC sign-in callback could lose the just-set route hash** (`#/people`), leaving the app stuck on a static loading screen until a manual reload; the callback path itself could also get durably cached by the service worker, single-use login code and all.
- **A known birth time at a latitude with no valid house solution (e.g. inside a polar circle on Placidus) crashed the report** instead of showing a fallback message — also found and fixed on the Composite and Harmonic chart screens, which shared the same gap.
- **Tier 2 consent is now re-required per request and per mode-dependent claim**, instead of being carried over past where it should apply; the third-party geocoder is now disclosed, and About's "zero network calls" claim is corrected.
- **The report screen now shows the same house-system-fallback warning the chart screen already did**, instead of silently dropping it on the dedicated report route.
- **corpus-gen:** same-point calculation-variant pairs (e.g. mean/true Lilith, mean/true node) are scoped out of aspect generation, and the ones that already shipped before the fix are pruned; the evaluation judge now treats these variants as calculation methods rather than flagging them as interchangeable; and a language-mismatch detection gap that let some wrong-language entries through undetected is closed.

### Documentation

- **ADR 0001 adopts HTML-first rendering as this project's documentation convention (#399),** with its own markdown drift fixed and a stale status/consequence/guardrail-scope audit closed.

## [0.21.3] — 2026-09-30

### Fixed

- **docker:** the production image crashed on boot with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `src/astrology/emphasis.ts` — freeform Tier-2 mode (v0.21.0) made `emphasis.ts` and `dignities.ts` real runtime dependencies, but the Dockerfile's hand-maintained runtime `COPY` allowlist had never been updated to include them. Both files are now copied into the runtime image, and two latent `.js`-vs-`.ts` import-extension bugs in `emphasis.ts`/`dignities.ts` that only surfaced once they ran under the built image are fixed alongside them.
- **astrology:** a property test in `test/astrology-properties.test.ts` was flaky, occasionally grazing its floating-point tolerance boundary; the tolerance is corrected and the test now passes reliably.
- **interpretation:** the English corpus was missing several thousand entries that already existed in Dutch — mostly synastry-aspect combinations involving asteroids, the nodes, and the Lilith variants — so those placements silently fell back or read as untranslated in English. The missing entries are filled in and the two locales are back in parity.

## [0.21.0] — 2026-09-29

**AI-Customized interpretation gains a second, freeform mode that lets the model originate its own reading from a reader's full chart, instead of only restyling reviewed corpus text.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — v1.0.0 hasn't shipped yet.

### Added

- **Freeform Tier-2 mode, alongside the existing grounded restyling.** The AI-Customized tab now offers a second mode where the model composes its own interpretation from the reader's exact computed positions, houses, and aspects, rather than restyling already-reviewed corpus text. This is a deliberate departure from grounded mode's stricter guarantee — freeform still never sends a name, birth date, or location, but it is far more granular than a placement key and the model can say things about the chart the corpus never wrote. Every id and key in the chart payload is still closed-set-revalidated server-side before it reaches the prompt, the same anti-injection discipline grounded mode already had. ADR 0003 is updated with the trade-off.
- **Tier-2 responses are now structured sections instead of one prose blob (#376).** The server asks the model for `{ sections: [{ heading, body }] }` via structured-output mode instead of free text, so the client renders real headings and paragraphs instead of guessing at line breaks in a single string.
- **diagnostics:** toggleable client tracing for the login/sync/render pipeline (#372). Gated behind localStorage so it costs nothing by default; instruments the login → sync → store → React-subscription → render handoff to make a stale-data-after-fresh-login race observable without attaching a debugger.

### Fixed

- **ui:** the topbar's theme/language toggles, sign-in button, demo badge, and signed-in controls now share one consistent pill style instead of each redefining their own height/radius/border (#367); Report table-of-contents links now scroll to their section instead of being swallowed by the app's global hash router (#373); the AI-Customized custom-prompt textarea spans the full card width instead of rendering narrow (#374).
- **interpretation:** Tier-2's 503 (no provider configured) now logs which env var is missing server-side, instead of leaving an admin to guess between two unrelated API keys (#375).
- **interpretation:** a misconfigured Tier-2 model id now names the model and the env var to fix in the server log, instead of a bare 404 with no id in it (#375).

## [0.20.0] — 2026-09-29

**A signed-in user can now ask an AI to restyle their interpretation in their own words, alongside the existing local corpus text.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — v1.0.0 hasn't shipped yet.

### Added

- **Tier-2 AI-customized interpretation, opt-in and per-request (#360).** The Interpretation screen (renamed from "Report", since it now covers both tiers) gains a "Standard"/"AI-Customized" sub-tab pair. Turning on Tier 2 sends only de-identified placement keys — never the chart itself — plus a guardrailed free-text style/tone/focus field to a configurable third-party model (disabled with a clear 503 if no provider is set), behind a consent checkbox, a prompt-injection/fatalistic/medical-legal-financial-phrasing/PII-shape check that runs both client-side and authoritatively on the server, and per-user and total daily cost caps on top of the existing rate limit. ADR 0003 records the data-minimization and cost-cap reasoning. Also fixes a bug this work surfaced before it could ship: the production Docker image was missing runtime files the new routes depend on and would have crashed the whole server at startup, not just failed to offer Tier 2.

### Fixed

- **Interpretation corpus:** a batch of synastry-aspect entries shipped in English under the Dutch locale; the batch is reverted and a language-mismatch lint gate now catches this class of mistake before it ships again (#371).
- **corpus-gen:** Ollama requests now set an explicit context size, instead of relying on a default that could silently truncate longer prompts.

## [0.19.0] — 2026-09-28

**Admins can now correct the interpretation corpus straight from the app, and purging a person now actually erases their data everywhere it had synced — not just on the device that ran it.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — the human review of high-salience corpus entries (#63) is still open, and v1.0.0 hasn't shipped. This release also closes out every finding from the September security/privacy audit (priority-high, -medium and -low) and its accessibility follow-ups.

### Added

- **Admin-editable interpretation corpus, with promote-only auto-promotion and a corrections export (#292, #349).** A new `/admin/corpus-overrides` screen lets an admin browse and correct any corpus entry per locale. Corrections are served ahead of the static text — `GET /api/corpus-overrides/:locale` stays public, since it only ever replaces text every visitor already gets from the static corpus — and can be exported for review. `ASTRAYA_ADMIN_USERNAMES` and `ASTRAYA_OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS`/`ASTRAYA_OIDC_ADMIN_GROUP_CLAIM` add env-configured admin auto-promotion alongside the existing manual Promote button, deliberately promote-only so removing a name or group can never cause a surprise lockout.
- **Synastry now shows real per-aspect interpretive text, and Composite/Harmonic charts get their first report text at all (#359, #365).** A new synastry-aspect corpus category, generated with a local Ollama/Mistral backend (`--provider`) that no longer depends on a hosted API. Comes with the corpus's first automated verification signal — a fact-grounding judge plus classical-source triage against Lilly's _Christian Astrology_ for dignity-state entries — which flagged 95 of 168 shipped dignity-state entries (57%) as diverging from the classical source, surfaced for #292's ongoing human review rather than auto-corrected.
- **corpus-gen tooling can bootstrap a locale's corpus from scratch now**, with a throughput-aware progress bar and crash-safe atomic writes, instead of requiring an existing (even empty) corpus file to start from.

### Changed

- **The birth-place map is gone; picking a birth place is search-only now (#348).** Typing a place name and choosing from the match list is enough precision for natal astrology (about 111 km of position error before an Ascendant shifts), and it never discloses exact coordinates to a third party, only this app's own server. The Leaflet map, "Use my location", and reverse-geocoding are all removed.

### Fixed

- **sync:** purging a person now propagates the erasure to every already-synced peer and to server-side storage, instead of staying local to the device that ran it (#308, #361).
- **security:** every finding from the September security/privacy audit is closed — proxy headers are no longer trusted by default, every auth/admin/ops route is rate-limited, each browser tab holds an exclusive write lock, and clock-skewed ops are quarantined instead of retried forever (#309-#312, #346); sixteen priority-medium findings across server transactions/quotas, auth/admin hardening, sync-protocol correctness, PWA cache scoping and log redaction, session lifecycle, and chart/ephemeris performance (#313-#327, #337, #347); and fifteen priority-low findings including attribute-safe SVG escaping, an Origin check as CSRF defence in depth, timing-safe bootstrap-token comparison, a prototype-pollution guard on synced operation fields, HSTS when served over HTTPS, and a key-rotation script for a leaked encryption key (#328-#343, #345).
- **security:** the corpus-overrides admin routes are now rate-limited like every other route, and deleting an admin no longer throws a foreign-key error — their overrides cascade with them (#351, #352, #362).
- **security:** the public corpus-overrides endpoint no longer discloses which admin made a correction, and admin-edited overrides now go through the same content lint (length, fatalistic phrasing, medical/legal/financial claims, gendered pronouns) as every machine-generated entry (#353, #354, #363).
- **a11y:** the corpus-overrides admin panel now gives Saving/Reset busy-state feedback and an aria-live result count, and the admin screens have axe-core end-to-end coverage for the first time (#355-#358, #364).
- **security:** GitHub Actions workflow permissions are no longer overly broad (#297).

### Documentation

- **agents:** subagent definitions rewritten for Astraya's actual architecture, later extended with a domain-correctness astrologer reviewer, and the full security/privacy audit that produced this release's fix list checked in (#344).
- repo and Pages links now point at the lowercase `astraya` slug (#350).

## [0.18.1] — 2026-09-21

Patch release: a bug fix and two related additions to the birth-place map's geocoding, none of them milestone work.

### Fixed

- **"Fill in place name" no longer fails with a CORS error against the default Nominatim provider (#294).** Nominatim only grants CORS to requests that carry a `Referer` header, but Astraya's server sets a blanket `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` on every response — the reverse-geocoding request never got the same referrer-policy override the map's tile requests already had. It now does, disclosing only this site's origin to Nominatim, same trade-off as the tiles.

### Added

- **MapTiler can now serve geocoding too, not just map tiles (#294).** If `VITE_MAPTILER_API_KEY` is already set, it's reused automatically for both "Fill in place name" and the new search field below — MapTiler authenticates by that key, not by `Referer`, so no referrer is ever sent to it. Nothing further to set.
- **"Search for a place by name" on the birth-place map (#290).** A new field above the map, the reverse direction of "Fill in place name" — turns a free-text place name into candidate coordinates instead of the other way around. Matches are always a click-to-confirm list, even for a single match, so a search never silently moves the pin: picking one fills both the Latitude/Longitude fields and Place of birth. Shares the same provider configuration as "Fill in place name" — no new setup for self-hosters or MapTiler users.

## [0.18.0] — 2026-09-21

**The birth-place map can now fill in the place name for you.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — v1.0.0 hasn't shipped yet.

### Added

- **"Fill in place name" button on the birth-place map (#291).** Sits in the same slot as "Use my location", shown once Latitude/Longitude are set instead of before it. Resolves the coordinates to the nearest town or city (falling back through town, village, hamlet, municipality and county) via Nominatim, plus the country when available, and fills the Place of birth field with it. The field stays plain free text afterwards, exactly as if typed by hand — it's a label for the reader, never re-derived or locked, and never touched again by this button. A self-hoster can point both `VITE_NOMINATIM_URL` and the server's `ASTRAYA_GEOCODE_ORIGIN` at their own reverse-geocoding server instead of the public Nominatim default — see README.md and `.env.example`.

### Fixed

- **The Harbor replication scan now checks the tag it actually replicates, not a version tag that never gets pulled.** The replication policy only mirrors `latest`, so gating on a version tag like `0.17.0` always 404ed on the scan endpoint; it now waits on `latest` moving, and skips prereleases entirely, since `latest` never moves for those. Release-pipeline-internal; nothing user-facing changed.

## [0.17.0] — 2026-09-16

**Production image moves off Alpine (musl) onto Chainguard/Wolfi (glibc), and there's now a static, no-accounts demo build published to GitHub Pages.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — the human review of high-salience corpus entries (#63) is still open, and v1.0.0 hasn't shipped. Keyboard/screen-reader accessibility (#69) and a documented deploy target with a live AGPL source link (#73) are both closed as of this release.

### Changed

- **Production image now builds on Chainguard/Wolfi (glibc) instead of Alpine (musl) (#273, #272).** The main reason is correctness, not size: `@node-rs/argon2` ships separate prebuilt binaries for `-gnu` and `-musl` libc, and staying on musl was one more place a native dependency could silently resolve to the wrong ABI. Chainguard's runtime image also has no shell or package manager and gets frequent upstream CVE rebuilds. The image itself is larger as a result (~546 MB vs ~410 MB), which is an accepted tradeoff, not a regression — there was no size budget in this repo to begin with. The old Alpine build is kept as `Dockerfile.alpine` for reference but is no longer built by CI.

### Added

- **A static, no-accounts demo build, published to GitHub Pages (#73).** `npm run build:demo` produces a build with sign-in and sync disabled entirely — there's no server for it to talk to — and a new `VITE_BASE_PATH` variable makes the app (including the service worker and its precache manifest) work correctly from a subpath. Live at [nrosier.github.io/astraya](https://nrosier.github.io/astraya/), deployed by `.github/workflows/pages.yml` on tagged releases. `.env.example` now documents Vite's mode-selection mechanism (`development`/`production`/`test`/the new `demo`), which was in use but undocumented.

## [0.16.1] — 2026-09-15

Patch release: two bug fixes and one opt-in feature, none of them milestone work.

### Fixed

- **The birth-place map now notices when OpenStreetMap silently blocks it (#267).**
  OSM's tile server can return `200 OK` with a valid-looking "blocked" placeholder
  tile instead of an error when it's throttling a deployment — the map used to
  show that placeholder as if the tiles had loaded fine. It's now detected and
  shown as the existing "map unavailable" warning instead.
- **The theme/language toggle's icon is centered in its button now (#268).** It
  was sitting slightly off-center.

### Added

- **The report's "Advisor" persona picker is now opt-in (#62).**
  `VITE_ENABLE_REPORT_PERSONAS` (off by default, see `.env.example`) controls it.
  Personas are newer and less-reviewed than the report's neutral voice, so a
  deployer now turns them on rather than every build getting them for free. A
  device that already had a persona chosen keeps it hidden and falls back to the
  neutral voice while the setting is off.

## [0.16.0] — 2026-09-15

**Report is now its own page instead of a hidden query parameter on the chart
page.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — accessibility (#69),
static build deploy (#73), and the human review of high-salience corpus entries
(#63) are still open, and v1.0.0 hasn't shipped.

### Fixed

- **Report has its own address now (#271).** It used to live at
  `#/chart/:id?tab=report`; now it is `#/report/:id`, so the Report link in
  the nav points at its own page instead of the chart page's, and no longer
  carries the chart page's leftover chrome — the Positions/Houses/Aspects/
  Dignities/Derived-points sub-tabs and the share-link button, both dating
  from before Report was split out of the natal chart page. The new page
  shows only the report text.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-09-15

**A round of small navigation and layout bug fixes: first login no longer
flashes blank, the Report tab works correctly from every entry point, and a
few dead-end links are gone.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — accessibility (#69),
static build deploy (#73), and the human review of high-salience corpus entries
(#63) are still open, and v1.0.0 hasn't shipped.

### Fixed

- **First login no longer shows a blank page for a frame (#263):** the route
  the app lands on before redirecting to the people list now renders a status
  message immediately instead of nothing, and creating the very first account
  goes straight to the people list rather than bouncing through it.
- **The chart page's Report tab no longer duplicates itself (#264):** the
  per-chart tab strip already had its own "Report" button sitting alongside
  the identical one in the top-level person nav; the strip's copy is gone —
  the nav's is the only way to reach it.
- **The Report nav tab now works without a reload (#265):** clicking it from
  an already-open chart page used to change only the hash, leaving the tab
  strip's own state stale until a reload; the chart page now listens for the
  change instead of only reading it once when it first mounts.
- **The people list's "back" link went nowhere useful (#266):** it pointed at
  the same page it was already on, so it's been removed.
- **Composite charts no longer show a natal-style report (#269):** the
  Report tab on a composite (midpoint) chart rendered individual-voiced
  interpretive text keyed off degrees that belong to no real person. It now
  shows a plain "not available yet" message instead, matching how
  Synastry — the other two-person chart — makes no such claim either.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-09-14

**A free MapTiler API key is now a drop-in fix for the birth-place map's
tile-blocking on production deployments, and the per-person tab bar got a
visual refresh.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — accessibility (#69),
static build deploy (#73), and the human review of high-salience corpus entries
(#63) are still open, and v1.0.0 hasn't shipped.

### Added

- **A MapTiler API key as a lower-effort alternative to self-hosting (#267):**
  set `VITE_MAPTILER_API_KEY` (and
  `ASTRAYA_TILE_ORIGIN=https://api.maptiler.com`) to sidestep OpenStreetMap's
  referrer-based blocking without running a tile server of your own —
  MapTiler authenticates by the key itself, not by the browser's `Referer`
  header. See `.env.example` and README.md for this alongside the existing
  self-hosted option. With neither configured, the map now falls back to a
  referrer-policy override on tile requests, which helps but doesn't
  eliminate the blocking risk described in #261 and #267.

### Changed

- **The per-person tab bar now reads as one bordered box (#234):** the tab
  strip and the view beneath it are visually fused — the active tab matches
  the content panel's background and sits flush against it — instead of a
  borderless strip floating above the page.

### Fixed

- The footer text is now centered.
- Dev-only: the #64 guard against runtime LLM API access no longer flags
  MapTiler's key as a violation — it authenticates map tiles, not a model
  provider, and is meant to ship in the client bundle like any other
  browser-side map API key.

## [0.13.1] — 2026-09-14

**Fixes a rendering bug in v0.13.0's own changelog entry.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — accessibility (#69),
static build deploy (#73), and the human review of high-salience corpus entries
(#63) are still open, and v1.0.0 hasn't shipped.

### Fixed

- **The in-app changelog no longer shows unrendered bold markers (v0.13.0):**
  its Markdown renderer treats each list item as a single physical line, so a
  bold span whose closing marker fell on a wrapped continuation line was left
  unclosed and shown as literal asterisks instead of bold text. Reworded that
  entry so the bold phrase and its closing marker share one line.
  `test/markdown.test.ts` renders the committed CHANGELOG.md itself and now
  catches this class of bug before it ships.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-09-14

**A console warning points operators at the self-hosted tile server docs when the
default OpenStreetMap tile server blocks a deployment's traffic.**

M9 (Polish & launch) progress, not a finished milestone — accessibility (#69),
static build deploy (#73), and the human review of high-salience corpus entries
(#63) are still open, and v1.0.0 hasn't shipped.

### Fixed

- **The birth-place map now explains tile failures, not just shows them (#261):**
  the default tile server (`tile.openstreetmap.org`, used whenever
  `VITE_TILE_URL_TEMPLATE` is unset) enforces a usage policy that blocks clients
  without an identifying `User-Agent` or that exceed its limits — something any
  real deployment's traffic is expected to eventually trip. The map already fell
  back to a visible "unavailable" message when tiles failed to load, but nothing
  pointed at the cause. A one-time console warning, logged only when the default
  server's tiles fail, now points whoever has the console open at README.md's
  self-hosted tile server section — which now also says plainly that the default
  isn't meant for production traffic.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-09-14

**The whole UI now switches between English and Dutch — chart tables, forms,
settings, and everything else, not just the interpretation report — completing
M10.**

This closes internationalization (#158), the last open item in M10 (Extended
techniques & world charts). M9's own release (v1.0.0) still hasn't shipped.

### Added

- **Full English/Dutch UI internationalization (#158):** the existing
  report-language toggle now switches the entire app. Every screen — chart
  views, profections, synastry, transits, composite/harmonic charts,
  astrocartography, forms, account, admin, extended settings, and about —
  renders fully in the chosen language, with no leftover English. Dates,
  times, and coordinates reformat for the locale, and sign/planet/aspect names
  shown in chart tables are translated using the same standard Dutch
  astrological vocabulary as the interpretation report. House-system names,
  ayanamsas, and a handful of compound technical labels (ARMC, Vertex, Part of
  Fortune, and similar) stay in English, matching how such terms are
  conventionally handled.

### Fixed

- Dev-only: the AstroChart reference wheel now renders alongside Astraya's own
  in development builds instead of one at a time, making the two easier to
  compare. Production, which never had the toggle, is unaffected.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-09-14

**A map-based way to set a birth place, "use my location" to center it, a
persistent per-person tab bar, and the sync-status explanation moved onto the
badge itself.**

This is M10 (Extended techniques & world charts) progress, not a finished
milestone: internationalization (#158) is still open.

### Added

- **Map-based birth-place picker (#159):** an embedded Leaflet + OpenStreetMap
  map with a draggable pin, shown alongside the existing Latitude/Longitude
  fields as a second way to set the same two fields — either stays a single
  source of truth for the other. Degrades to a visible "map unavailable"
  message (not a silent blank area) if tiles can't load, and needs no API key
  for the default public-tile configuration; self-hosting your own tile
  server is documented.
- **"Use my location" (#248):** an opt-in button on the birth-place map that
  pans/zooms to the browser's reported position. It only ever moves the map's
  view, never the pin or the coordinate fields, so centering the map is never
  mistaken for picking a birth place. Shows an inline message if permission
  is denied or the position can't be determined.
- Persistent per-person tab bar, with the "Birth record" tab gated until a
  person has one; the home screen is retired in favour of the people list
  (#234).

### Changed

- The "local only"/sync-status explanation is now a disclosure popover
  anchored to the sync badge itself, discoverable from every screen, instead
  of a footer notice that only appeared on screens long enough to scroll past
  it (#250).

## [0.10.1] — 2026-09-13

**UI cleanup: no more duplicate sign-in messaging, dev-only controls hidden in
production, a direct link to the report, and a bigger chart wheel.**

### Fixed

- Sign-in and sync-status text no longer repeat the same message in two
  places (#230).
- Developer/reference-only controls (extended settings, wheel-style toggle,
  report provenance checkbox) are now hidden in production builds (#231).
- The natal chart wheel and aspect grid rendered too small; both are now
  bigger (#233).

### Added

- A "Report" link in the per-person chart nav, and "View chart" renamed to
  "Natal chart" for clarity (#232).

## [0.10.0] — 2026-09-13

**Six new chart types ship together: profections, transits, synastry, composite,
harmonic/Varga charts, periodic transit forecasts, and now astrocartography — plus
a fix for PNG export, which was silently broken for every chart in the app.**

This is M10 (Extended techniques & world charts) progress, not a finished
milestone: internationalization (#158) and the map-based birth-place picker
(#159) are still open, and M9's own release (v1.0.0, #120) hasn't shipped
either. None of the M10 features below have been in a tagged release before —
they landed on `main` after `v0.9.6` and are all going out together now.

### Added

- **Astrocartography and Local Space lines (#171):** a world map of where each
  planet's angles (MC/IC/AC/DC) fall right now, plus optional Local Space
  lines (azimuth vectors from the birthplace) and relocation (recompute the
  Ascendant/Midheaven for another place without moving any line). Traditional
  bodies are shown by default; Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are available as an
  extended option. Exports to SVG and PNG like every other chart.
- Periodic transit forecast screen (#207): solar-return-anchored forecasts of
  upcoming transits, with narrative text.
- Harmonic and Vedic Varga chart screen (#170).
- Composite (midpoint) chart screen (#169).
- Transit and synastry bi-wheel screens (#172).
- Annual and monthly profections (#168).
- Topbar tab order, popover keyboard handling, and table semantics fixes for
  keyboard and screen-reader use (#69).

### Fixed

- **PNG export was broken for every chart in the app.** Chart PNG downloads
  rasterize the chart's SVG through a `blob:` URL, but the Content Security
  Policy's `img-src` directive never allowed `blob:`, so the browser silently
  blocked the image and the download failed. No end-to-end test exercised the
  "Download PNG" button anywhere, so this shipped unnoticed until
  astrocartography's manual verification caught it. Fixed by adding `blob:` to
  `img-src` in both the server's CSP header and `index.html`'s meta tag.
- Forecast screen (#207): narrative text and formatting fixes.
- Dialog semantics and focus loss on route change, for screen readers (#69).
- An end-to-end test now waits for the service worker's post-activation reload
  before the first store write, instead of racing it (#229).
- Degenerate Horizon-system house cusps are now detected and rejected instead
  of returning nonsense angles (#184).
- The default search budget for outer-planet returns was too narrow and could
  miss a return near the search boundary; widened (#71).
- CI now actually runs a pull request's built image, not just builds it.

### Performance

- Dropped a redundant ephemeris call from crossing bisection (#71).
- The ephemeris worker is now reused across chart recomputes instead of
  restarted each time (#71).

## [0.9.6] — 2026-09-12

**Authentik sign-in actually works now, end to end.**

Three fixes, all discovered while chasing one report ("Authentik sign-in
appears to succeed but the app stays signed out") and verified against a real
Authentik deployment via the `0.9.5-debug.1`/`0.9.5-debug.2` diagnostic builds
below:

### Fixed

- Authentik sign-in: ID-token verification now accepts the issuer with or
  without a trailing slash, matching what Authentik actually sends — this
  was the reason every sign-in was silently rejected.
- The admin-bootstrap link now points at `/#/setup?token=...`, and a form for
  it now exists — previously there was no client-side route or component for
  it at all, so the link silently did nothing.
- Signing in with Authentik now requests the `profile` scope, so the account
  gets a real username instead of the raw, opaque subject identifier.
  Accounts already provisioned under that raw identifier are not migrated —
  this only changes what a _new_ sign-in is named.

### Removed

- The `[oidc-debug]` diagnostic logging added in `0.9.5-debug.1` to trace the
  sign-in bug — no longer needed now that the root cause is fixed.

## [0.9.5-debug.2] — 2026-09-12

**Diagnostic build — candidate fixes for the Authentik sign-in bug, for verification.**

The debug logging shipped in `0.9.5-debug.1` traced the reported bug (Authentik
sign-in appears to succeed but the app stays signed out, local-only) to a real
cause: Authentik's ID token carries an `iss` claim with a trailing slash, which
did not exactly match the configured issuer, so token verification rejected
every sign-in while the failure was silently swallowed. It also surfaced a
second, unrelated bug found while investigating: the printed admin-bootstrap
link (`/setup?token=...`) never matched the app's hash-routed URLs, so it always
opened the home screen instead of a form. This prerelease carries fixes for
both, for verification against a real Authentik deployment before they ship in
a normal release. It does not move the `latest` Docker tag.

### Fixed

- Authentik sign-in: ID-token verification now accepts the issuer with or
  without a trailing slash, matching what Authentik actually sends.
- The admin-bootstrap link now points at `/#/setup?token=...`, and a form for
  it now exists — previously there was no client-side route or component for
  it at all, so the link silently did nothing.

## [0.9.5-debug.1] — 2026-09-12

**Diagnostic build — Authentik sign-in debug logging, not a fix.**

This is a prerelease built to investigate a report that signing in with Authentik
appears to succeed but the app keeps showing "Sign in" and local-only sync status.
It does not move the `latest` Docker tag.

### Added

- Console and server-log tracing (`[oidc-debug]`) through every step of the
  Authentik sign-in exchange: the redirect handshake, the callback's code/state
  handling, the server's token exchange and ID-token verification, nonce
  checking, account matching, session-cookie creation, and every `/api/auth/me`
  check. A failure partway through this flow used to be swallowed silently on
  the client; it is now logged with the reason.

## [0.9.5] — 2026-09-12

**Sign-in and sync status are now visible everywhere, and the report language is an app-wide setting.**

### Added

- **Sign-in status now lives top-left on every screen**, including the
  landing page, which previously had no login affordance at all — "am I
  signed in" answers itself without navigating anywhere. Sync status moves
  to top-right next to a manual sync button, showing "Server online" /
  "Sync failing" etc. alongside the signed-in username.
- **The report's language picker is now a shared, app-wide setting**
  instead of a per-report control, sitting next to the theme toggle. Any
  open report updates live when it changes.

### Fixed

- **A rare random-testing counterexample could fail CI without indicating a real bug.**
  The property test verifying sidereal longitude against the ayanamsa allowed
  60 arcseconds of divergence for minor bodies under fixed-epoch/galactic
  ayanamsa modes — a genuine property of the underlying ephemeris engine, not
  a defect — but a rare seed found a combination (Pallas, under the
  galactic-alignment ayanamsa) that exceeded it by a quarter of an arcsecond.
  The tolerance is now 90 arcseconds, still tight enough to catch a real
  regression.

## [0.9.3] — 2026-09-12

**Fixes "Sign in with Authentik" failing with a cross-origin error.**

### Fixed

- **Signing in with Authentik could fail with a cross-origin error.** The
  sign-in button fetched the identity provider's discovery document directly
  from the browser, which depends on the provider sending CORS headers on
  that endpoint — Authentik does not, by default. The server already
  resolves and caches that document for the token exchange, so the client
  now gets the authorization endpoint from the server instead of fetching
  the issuer itself. The Content-Security-Policy no longer needs to grant
  the issuer origin for fetches at all, only for the redirect itself.

## [0.9.2] — 2026-09-11

**Choose the report's language and advisor voice.**

### Added

- **Language and advisor pickers on the Report tab.** The interpretation
  report (M7) could already be generated in English or Dutch, and in any of
  five advisor personas or a neutral voice — but the UI only ever rendered
  the neutral English version. Two new selects on the Report tab expose both
  choices directly, remembered per device via `localStorage` so a returning
  visitor doesn't have to reselect them.

### Fixed

- **The Report tab always assembled its text in English**, even when the
  fetched corpus was for another locale — a latent bug from before this
  picker existed, now unreachable since the selected locale is always the
  one used.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-09-11

**Fixes the published Docker image, which crashed on startup.**

### Fixed

- **The 0.9.0 image never actually served a request.** `server/ops/routes.ts`
  imports HLC timestamp parsing (`decodeHlc`, `isHlc`) directly from the
  client's `src/store/hlc.ts` — deliberately, so the server can never drift
  from the client's own idea of what a timestamp is — but the Dockerfile's
  runtime stage only ever copied `dist/` and `server/`, never `src/`. The
  container crashed immediately with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on every boot.
  `npm run check` never caught this because it runs against a full checkout
  where `src/` is present; only the image's own smoke test could have, and it
  ran _after_ the image was already pushed. The Dockerfile now copies the one
  self-contained file the server needs, by name, rather than the whole client
  tree.
- This also means `0.9.0`'s published `latest`, `0.9`, `1` and `0.9.0` Docker
  tags were broken from the moment they were pushed until this release
  superseded them. If you pulled `niqck/astraya` at any of those tags before
  now, pull again.

### Notes on correctness

- No application code changed — this is a build/deploy fix only. `npm run check`
  is green across the full suite, including the golden-chart gate.
- Verified locally: `docker build` then `docker run`, confirming `/healthz`
  now returns `200` instead of the container exiting on `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-09-11

**Accounts, sync across devices, and optional Authentik sign-in.**

Astraya still works with zero configuration and no account, exactly as
before — everything below is additive and opt-in.

### Added

- **Local accounts and a bootstrap admin flow.** A new server-side SQLite
  store (`users`, `sessions`, `ops`) backs an optional account system:
  Argon2id password hashing, HttpOnly session cookies, and a one-time
  bootstrap token logged on startup (or set via `ASTRAYA_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`)
  to create the first admin.
- **Sync across devices.** Signing in opens a per-account database and
  starts a push/pull sync engine against a new operation-log relay
  (`POST`/`GET /api/ops`). The relay is intentionally opaque — it stores an
  encrypted blob per operation and never interprets it, so new client
  fields never require a server migration. Conflicts resolve deterministically
  via the existing per-field, HLC-ordered last-write-wins merge (built in
  M3), now proven under sync with a 200-iteration property test and a
  two-browser-context end-to-end test covering offline edits, concurrent
  same-field edits, and delete-vs-edit races.
- **Encryption at rest.** When `ASTRAYA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set, every stored
  operation payload is encrypted with AES-256-GCM before it touches disk.
  Left unset, the relay stays disabled with a clear log line — no silent
  half-configured state.
- **Adopt anonymous data on first sign-in.** Signing in on a device that
  already has anonymous local data offers to bring it into the new account,
  asked once per device; declining (or a second, different account signing
  in later) never touches or re-offers it.
- **Optional Authentik (OIDC) sign-in.** When `ASTRAYA_OIDC_ISSUER` is
  configured, a "Sign in with Authentik" option appears alongside local
  accounts, using Authorization Code + PKCE with server-side token exchange
  — the browser never holds an access or ID token. Signing out ends
  Authentik's own session too (RP-initiated logout). The CSP header widens
  to allow the issuer only when one is actually configured.
- **Admin panel.** Admins can list users, create accounts (via a one-time
  set-password link), reset passwords, promote/demote, disable/enable, and
  delete users — with a last-remaining-admin guard on every destructive
  action and a preview of how much data a deletion would remove before it's
  confirmed.
- **CSV export and a print stylesheet** for every chart data table, with
  page breaks kept from splitting a table or the chart wheel mid-row.

### Notes on correctness

- No calculation path was touched.
- `npm run check` is green across all 111 test files / 1362 tests,
  including the golden-chart gate at its usual 0.2″ tolerance.
- `npm run ephe:sync` reports no digest change.
- Verified manually: bootstrap → sign-in → sync between two profiles →
  offline edit → reconnect convergence; admin create/disable/promote/
  delete flows, including the last-admin guard and the deletion-impact
  preview.
- Manual end-to-end verification against a live Authentik instance is still
  outstanding (tracked for a follow-up pass); automated OIDC coverage runs
  against an in-process fake Authentik instead.

## [0.8.5] — 2026-09-11

**A Symbol column, and the Ascendant/Midheaven folded into Positions.**

A small patch matching Astro-Seek's own table layout more closely.

### Added

- **A Symbol column on the Positions table**, showing each body's traditional
  glyph (☉ ☽ ☿ ♀ ♂ etc.) as the leftmost column — plain Unicode rather than
  the wheel's SVG glyphs, since a table cell round-trips through Copy/CSV
  export as plain text.
- **The Ascendant and Midheaven now appear as two extra rows in the Positions table**,
  instead of the Houses tab's separate Angles table, matching Astro-Seek's
  combined layout. They show no House/Speed/Rx columns, since neither angle
  sits in a house or moves the way a body does. The Houses tab's Angles
  table still lists ARMC, the Equatorial Ascendant, both Co-Ascendants and
  the Polar Ascendant. The move is gated by the same flag that already
  hides the whole houses/angles picture for an unknown-birth-time chart, so
  that case still shows Positions with no Ascendant/Midheaven rows.

### Notes on correctness

- No calculation path was touched — this is a display-layer reshuffle of
  data Astraya already computed.
- `npm run ephe:sync` reports no digest change.
- Verified manually in a running browser: the Symbol column renders for
  every body, the Ascendant/Midheaven rows show dashes where House/Speed/Rx
  would be, the Houses tab's Angles table now starts at ARMC, an unknown-
  birth-time chart still omits the Ascendant/Midheaven rows, and CSV/TSV
  export includes the new column and rows.

## [0.8.4] — 2026-09-11

**Extended chart settings, Astro-Seek style.**

Another patch carrying feature work: `0.9.0` is still reserved for milestone
M8, and everything here is either wiring up options Astraya already computed
under the hood, or a cosmetic wheel option — no new calculation capability.

### Added

- **An "Extended settings" panel on the chart view**, modeled on Astro-Seek's
  own panel of the same name: house system, zodiac, orb rules, minor
  aspects, which points are shown, which points participate in aspect-
  finding, and a cosmetic wheel option, all editable as a draft with one
  "Redraw" action.
- **House system selector**, covering all 24 systems Astraya already
  supports, and a **Tropical/Sidereal zodiac switch** with an ayanamsa
  picker for every ayanamsa Astraya knows.
- **The default orb rules now match Astro-Seek's own**: major aspects at 7°
  (10° with a luminary), sextile at 4° (5°30′ with a luminary), and every
  minor aspect at a flat 2°30′ — replacing Astraya's previous per-aspect orb
  table. A ±90% scale slider widens or narrows all three tiers at once.
- **Minor aspects, and aspects to Chiron/Lilith/the Lunar Nodes, default off**,
  matching Astro-Seek's own defaults. Each is an individual toggle: six
  minor-aspect checkboxes, and one "aspects to" checkbox per body. This
  narrows what the Aspects tab and matrix show by default; nothing is hidden
  that isn't computed — turning a toggle on computes and shows it for real.
- **Point-display toggles** for the Part of Fortune, the Vertex, Chiron and
  a new pair of **ASC/MC and Sun/Moon midpoint rows** in the Derived points
  tab (the same two Astro-Seek shows inline on its own chart page). Chiron
  defaults visible; the other three default hidden.
- **Lilith and the Lunar Nodes each get a Mean/True variant switch** — Astro-
  Seek's "True Lilith" maps to Swiss Ephemeris's osculating apogee, since
  there is no literal "true Lilith" flag in the ephemeris.
- **Rainbow Color Zodiac**, a cosmetic wheel option coloring each of the
  twelve sign wedges individually, available on both of Astraya's wheel
  renderings (its own, and the AstroChart alternate from 0.8.3).

### Notes on correctness

- The golden-chart gate continues to pass at its 0.2″ historical tolerance;
  no calculation path was touched by the point-visibility or panel work.
  The orb-rule and aspect-participation defaults are a deliberate, called-
  out behavior change (see above), not a regression.
- **Verified manually in a running browser**: every toggle in the panel
  (house system, sidereal + ayanamsa, orb scale, a minor aspect, Chiron/
  Fortune/Vertex/midpoints visibility, Lilith's True variant, aspects to
  Chiron, Rainbow Color Zodiac) was exercised against a live chart and
  produced the expected change.
- **A known, deliberate interaction**: turning "aspects to Chiron" on adds
  Chiron's resulting aspects to the wheel's chords as well as the tab and
  matrix, whenever those aspects are in the major family — the wheel's
  major-only aspect filter (shipped just before this release) filters by
  aspect family only, not by which bodies are involved, so it has no reason
  to treat Chiron differently from any other body once its aspects are
  turned on.
- **The Horizon house system ('H') is now excluded from the property test**,
  alongside Gauquelin sectors and the alternative Sunshine system. Its
  degenerate zone turned out not to be a fixed neighborhood around the
  equator, as a prior fix assumed, but to track the RAMC for the date and
  hour under test — sweeping latitude found it winding 11x across roughly
  ten degrees on one date, and only right at the equator on another. No
  fixed exclusion is safe against a property test that generates a random
  date and hour on every run, so 'H' is excluded outright rather than
  narrowing the latitude range for every other system to accommodate it.

## [0.8.3] — 2026-09-10

**A second wheel rendering, drawn by AstroChart.**

Another patch carrying feature work: `0.9.0` is still reserved for milestone
M8, and this adds an alternate on-screen view rather than changing how a
chart is computed.

### Added

- **A toggle between two wheel renderings.** Alongside Astraya's own wheel
  (redrawn in 0.8.2), the chart view can now render the radix wheel with the
  third-party [AstroChart](https://github.com/AstroDraw/AstroChart) library
  (MIT) instead. AstroChart is the default view; a small toggle switches
  back to Astraya's own rendering.
- **Exports are unaffected either way.** The SVG/PNG/PDF export buttons
  always export Astraya's own rendering, regardless of which wheel is shown
  on screen, so downloaded charts are unchanged from 0.8.2.

### Notes on correctness

- The golden-chart gate continues to pass at its 0.2″ historical tolerance;
  no calculation path was touched.
- **Not verified in a browser for this release.** The new adapter and
  component are covered by unit and DOM-smoke tests, and the full suite and
  `npm run check` pass, but the toggle itself was not visually checked in a
  running browser before release.

## [0.8.2] — 2026-09-10

**The wheel redrawn in the Astrodienst style.**

Another patch carrying feature work rather than only fixes, for the same
reason as 0.8.1: `0.9.0` is still reserved for milestone M8, and nothing
here changes how a chart is computed — this is a look-and-feel port, not a
structural one.

### Added

- **Every glyph redrawn**, ported from Kerykeion's (AGPL-3.0) hand-drawn
  artwork rather than Astraya's own placeholder shapes: all ten planets,
  Chiron, both lunar node pairs (including a real south-node symbol, not a
  mirrored north node), the four major asteroids, all twelve signs, and all
  eleven aspect glyphs.
- **The ring band bodies sit in is wider**, closer to the Astrodienst
  proportion, so placements read less cramped near the chart's centre.
- **Aspects now sort into three colour families, not two.** Conjunction,
  semisextile, sextile and trine read as the harmonious family (blue);
  semisquare, square, sesquiquadrate and opposition as the hard family
  (red, unchanged); quintile, biquintile and quincunx get their own third
  colour rather than falling through to a flat neutral grey. The aspect
  grid repeats the same three-way colouring.
- **The structural rings have depth.** The zodiac band and the aspect disk
  are now lightly shaded rather than flat outlines, the single biggest
  lever on the wheel's "just outlines" look.
- **House cusps are drawn as reference lines, not features** — dashed and
  faint, so the angle lines (ASC/MC axis) stand out against them instead of
  blending in.

### Notes on correctness

- The golden-chart gate continues to pass at its 0.2″ historical tolerance.
  This release is drawing only; no calculation path was touched.
- **Not verified in a browser for this release.** The redesign was checked
  against the full structural chart test suite and by a manual diff review
  against the ported source artwork, not by opening a rendered chart.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-09-10

**Chart rendering, theming and export.**

A patch number carrying feature work rather than only fixes: the version table
reserves `0.9.0` for milestone M8, and nothing here changes how a chart is
computed.

### Added

- **A full chart sheet, not just a wheel.** One drawing now carries the
  birth details, the wheel itself, and a data panel beneath it: an aspect
  grid pairing every two bodies exactly once, an element and modality
  breakdown, and a strip showing how the chart's degrees cluster within a
  sign.
- **The wheel says what it is drawing.** Zodiac sign glyphs around the ring,
  degree ticks in three tiers, numbered houses, and each body annotated with
  its exact degree and minute — none of which the wheel had before.
- **Drawn at any size.** The sheet is described proportionally rather than in
  fixed pixels, so it is rendered at the size asked for instead of at one
  size and stretched. This is what makes a 2400px export sharp rather than
  enlarged.
- **Bi- and tri-wheels draw the same rings as the natal chart.** Comparing
  two charts previously lost the sign glyphs, tick tiers and house numbers a
  single chart got; there is now one renderer, and the natal chart is its
  one-ring case.
- **Hard and soft aspects are told apart at a glance**, red and blue, by the
  convention printed charts use — and an aspect is drawn only if the Aspects
  table on the same screen agrees it exists.
- **Export a chart as SVG, PNG or PDF.** The saved file carries its own
  styling, so it stays legible somewhere that has never loaded Astraya's
  stylesheet; PNG is rasterised at a size you pick.
- **A light/dark override** ([#70](https://github.com/nrosier/astraya/issues/70)),
  for disagreeing with the OS setting. The stored choice is applied before the
  first render, so it never flashes the other palette first.
- **Sortable chart tables**, by any column.

### Fixed

- **Four zodiac glyphs were wrong.** Aries was drawn inverted, which made it
  the lunar node's symbol rather than its own; Sagittarius' crossbar lay along
  its own arrow shaft and so drew nothing at all; Cancer and Capricorn were
  redrawn to be recognisable as their signs.
- **Crowded charts no longer print text on top of itself.** Where a cluster
  of bodies has no room for every degree label, labels are dropped rather
  than overlapped — the glyph and its pointer still carry the position, and
  the exact figure is in the table. The aspect grid's orb notation likewise
  shortens, then gives way to the aspect symbol alone, instead of being set
  at a size no renderer honours.

### Notes on correctness

- The golden-chart gate continues to pass at its 0.2″ historical tolerance.
  This release is rendering only; no calculation path was touched.
- **Not verified in a browser for this release.** The export buttons and
  print output were exercised through the rendering pipeline and by
  rasterising the result, but not by clicking them in a real browser. The
  sheet is also now taller than a printed page, so how a PDF splits it is
  unconfirmed.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-09-10

**Milestone M7 — interpretation.**

A chart has always been numbers and a picture. Now it also gets a written
report: plain-language text for what each placement means, chosen for the
chart in front of it rather than templated.

### Added

- **A written report tab**, assembling the placements a chart actually has
  into a readable page rather than a flat list of everything the corpus
  knows.
- **A salience-ranked rule engine.** Every placement in a chart competes for
  the report's attention on dignity, sect and angularity, not just category
  order, so the report leads with what the chart itself makes important.
- **A large interpretation corpus** — hand-written exemplars plus
  AI Studio-generated text, covering planets in sign and house, aspects,
  dignities, nakshatras and chart-shape patterns, in English and Dutch, with
  a typed schema and loader enforcing that every entry names a real body,
  sign or aspect rather than a typo that would silently never match a chart.
- **Five reading personas** (traditionalist, big sister, cynic, mystic,
  pragmatist), each with its own voice for the same placement, generated
  across the whole corpus and falling back to a neutral entry where a
  persona-specific one doesn't exist.
- **A "why this text?" provenance view**, showing whether a passage was
  hand-written or generated, and by what, next to the passage itself.
- **A coverage guarantee**: no placement a chart can produce is allowed to
  fall through to empty text — a fallback composition step covers any
  corpus gap so the report never shows a hole.
- Chart wheel wired into the chart screen itself, with rings, aspects and
  data tables now sharing one tabbed view instead of tables alone.
- Sharing a chart via a self-contained link, and permanently deleting a
  person's data on the device that holds it, next to the existing
  reversible delete.

### Notes on correctness

- **The corpus was linted and deduplicated as data, not just written and trusted.**
  An automated lint pass checks every entry's placement fields against the real
  astrology reference tables, and a similarity pass flags any two entries in the
  same locale that read too much alike; one flagged pair was rewritten and
  reverified before this release.
- **A CI check keeps the model out of the running app.** The corpus is
  generated at build time and committed as data — a lint rule fails the
  build if any code path in `src/` could reach a language-model client at
  runtime.
- **The corpus is fetched in chunks, not shipped whole.** A browser loads
  only its locale's neutral text plus, at most, one persona's chunk on top,
  rather than downloading every language and persona regardless of what a
  reader actually sees.
- The golden-chart gate continues to pass at its 0.2″ historical tolerance;
  none of this milestone's work touches how a chart's positions are
  computed.
- Human review of the corpus's highest-salience entries (~250 of them) is
  tracked separately and deliberately not a release gate for this version —
  see [#63](https://github.com/nrosier/astraya/issues/63).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-09-09

**Milestone M6 — progressions & returns.**

A chart is no longer just a fixed moment: Astraya now moves it forward, and
compares the result against the original.

### Added

- **Secondary progressions**, with a choice of Midheaven method — the
  progressed angles are one of the few places where astrologers genuinely
  disagree on the technique, so both are offered rather than picking one
  silently.
- **Solar arc directions**, advancing every body by the Sun's own secondary
  progression arc.
- **Tertiary and minor progressions**, the faster day-for-a-lunar-month and
  day-for-a-lunar-day variants, for the traditions that use them.
- **Solar and lunar returns**, found by root-finding directly against the
  Swiss Ephemeris rather than approximated, so a return's exact moment is as
  accurate as a natal chart's.
- **Planetary returns and the demibirthday** — a body's return to its natal
  degree, and the chart drawn for the midpoint of the solar year.
- **A cross-chart aspect engine**, comparing any two charts' bodies against
  each other — the same engine that powers progressions-to-natal and
  return-to-natal aspects, and every bi-wheel and tri-wheel drawn from here on.
- **A bi-wheel and tri-wheel renderer**, extending M5's chart wheel to show
  two or three charts at once, with a shared outer zodiac ring, per-ring house
  cusps, a fixed legend, and cross-ring aspect lines.

### Notes on correctness

- Return-finding is checked against its own root — a found return's body is
  re-measured at the found moment and must land within the same tolerance the
  golden-chart gate uses, rather than trusting the root-finder's convergence
  claim alone.
- The golden-chart gate continues to pass at its 0.2″ historical tolerance;
  none of this milestone's work touches how a single chart's positions are
  computed.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-09-09

**Milestone M5 — chart rendering.**

The wheel is drawn: a chart is now a picture, not just a table of numbers.

### Added

- **The SVG chart wheel.** Rings, degree ticks and house cusps, drawn as
  clean vector paths rather than a canvas bitmap, so the chart stays sharp at
  any size and its markup can be styled or queried like any other DOM.
- **A full glyph set** for every body, sign and aspect, with **collision spreading**:
  glyphs that would overlap at a shared longitude are nudged apart and given a
  short leader line back to their true position, so a crowded stellium stays
  readable instead of stacking illegibly.
- **The aspect web**, drawn as chords across the wheel's inner circle, with
  toggles for aspect type and orb tightness.
- **Wheel orientation and style options** — Ascendant-left or Aries-up,
  clockwise or counterclockwise — for the house and cultural conventions
  different traditions expect.
- **Overlay lines** for antiscia, declination parallels, and a 90° dial view
  of midpoint structures.
- **Data tables** for every computed quantity from M4 (positions, houses,
  aspects, dignities and the rest), so nothing computed is picture-only.

### Notes on correctness

- Every rendering module is pure and framework-free — it takes computed chart
  data and returns an SVG string, with no dependency on how or whether the
  app is running in a browser — so the geometry itself is unit-tested
  directly against the markup it produces.
- The golden-chart gate continues to pass at its 0.2″ historical tolerance;
  rendering builds on M4's data without touching how any of it is computed.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-09-09

**Milestone M4 — calculation core.**

The full chart data set is now computed for any birth moment: every body, every
house system, every dignity, and the traditional points and patterns astrologers
actually read a chart by.

### Added

- **The full body set.** Sun through Pluto, the lunar nodes, Lilith, Chiron and
  the outer asteroids, each with a validity window so requesting a position
  before an asteroid's ephemeris file starts fails honestly instead of
  returning a wrong number.
- **Every house system and ayanamsa.** All ~23 house systems Swiss Ephemeris
  supports, and all ~45 predefined ayanamsas with live tropical/sidereal
  toggling — not just Placidus and Lahiri.
- **Topocentric and heliocentric positions**, alongside the default geocentric
  view, for the handful of techniques that need them.
- **Aspects with configurable orbs**, essential dignities (rulership,
  exaltation, detriment, fall), triplicity rulers, bounds/terms, decans and
  faces, and peregrine/almuten scoring.
- **Sect and solar-relationship points**: day/night sect, combustion, cazimi,
  under-the-beams, and the sect-correct Part of Fortune and other Arabic parts.
- **Midpoints and the 90° dial**, antiscia and contra-antiscia, declinations
  with parallels/contraparallels and out-of-bounds flags.
- **Fixed stars**, sourced from `sefstars.txt`, with magnitude filtering and
  paran contacts to the chart's angles.
- **Dispositor chains, mutual reception and final dispositor**, Jones chart
  shapes (bowl, bucket, etc.), and element/modality/quadrant/hemisphere
  weighting.
- **Nakshatra and pada** for every body from its sidereal longitude.

### Fixed

- **Polar-latitude houses** no longer fail silently — a house system that
  can't be computed at extreme latitudes falls back and says so, rather than
  returning nonsense cusps.
- A house-cusp property-test regression was excluded pending a fix, so the
  calculation-core test suite stays a reliable gate rather than an
  intermittently-red one.

### Notes on correctness

- A property-test suite now runs the calculation core against thousands of
  generated birth moments, checking invariants (e.g. cusps sum correctly, an
  exalted body isn't also in detriment) rather than only fixed golden cases.
- The golden-chart gate — 11 bodies at 3 epochs checked against JPL Horizons —
  continues to pass at its 0.2″ historical tolerance.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-08

**Milestone M3 — local-first data and people.**

Astraya now remembers people. Everything typed lives on the device it was typed
on — no account, no server, no network call — and survives closing the tab,
losing the connection, or reopening the app a year later.

### Added

- **People.** Add a person, fill in their birth record, and find them again from
  the people list. A person with no birth data yet is shown as exactly that, not
  hidden or guessed at.
- **A local-first store.** Every change is an operation stamped with a hybrid
  logical clock and appended to a log in IndexedDB, so two devices' histories
  merge deterministically once sync exists (M8) with no server involved in
  deciding the outcome.
- **Deletes you can undo.** Removing a person hides them and their charts rather
  than erasing anything; the people list can bring them back.
- **A request to not be evicted.** The app asks the browser to persist its
  storage, and says so plainly when the browser refuses — this is the only copy
  of the data that exists.
- **A status line that will not reassure you falsely.** Every screen holding
  local data shows whether it exists anywhere else yet. Today the honest answer
  is always "only on this device" — accounts and sync land in M8.
- **The app works with the network off.** The app shell and the ephemeris files
  it needs are cached ahead of time, and a second visit with no connection at all
  loads and works exactly as it did the first time.

### Notes on correctness

- **Forward compatibility is built in, not promised.** Every stored operation
  carries a version number. A future build's operations are preserved untouched
  by an older one rather than dropped, so upgrading and downgrading devices
  cannot lose data between them.
- **A chart's settings are not the same register as its birth data.** A person's
  date, time and coordinates are written as whole values — a coordinate merged
  half from one device and half from another would be a place nobody was born —
  while chart settings merge field-by-field, because that is harmless there.
- 382 tests cover the store, the form validation, and the offline behaviour;
  the offline-shell and cache-storage behaviour was also verified against a real
  browser with the network genuinely disabled, not simulated.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-07

**Milestone M2 — time and place.**

Astraya can now work out _when_ a birth happened. That sounds like the easy part
and it is the single most common reason a chart is wrong: an offset that is off by
an hour moves the Ascendant by around 15 degrees, which is enough to change the
rising sign and every house boundary with it — and nothing about the result looks
wrong. So this release is less about calculating an offset than about showing its
reasoning and admitting what it cannot know.

Still no chart wheel. That starts in M4 and M5.

### Added

- **A "when and where" panel.** Enter a date, a time and coordinates, and it shows
  the UTC offset it arrived at, where that offset came from, and anything about the
  moment that deserves a second look.
- **Historical timezones, not today's.** Offsets are resolved for the date in
  question, so the US patchwork of 1918–1966, British Double Summer Time, Amsterdam
  Time before 1940 and Soviet decree time all resolve as they actually were.
- **Local Mean Time before standard time existed.** For a birth before roughly
  1880, the offset comes from longitude, because towns kept their own solar time and
  that is the clock the record meant.
- **A manual offset override.** A birth certificate that states the offset beats
  any lookup, so a stated offset wins outright over the database.
- **Dates in the Julian calendar**, chosen automatically against the 1582 reform or
  set by hand — Russia and Greece kept the Julian calendar into the twentieth
  century, so the date on an old record is not always the date it looks like.
- **Shareable links.** The address bar holds the whole record and stays readable —
  `#/time?d=1960-06-15&t=14:30&la=38.7478&lo=-85.0672` — so you can see what a link
  contains before you open it.
- **A night-sky palette**, in light and dark, applied across the app.

### Notes on correctness

- **Ambiguity is shown, not resolved by guessing.** When clocks go back, a
  wall-clock time genuinely happens twice and nothing in the date can say which was
  meant. Astraya uses the first, says so, and shows the alternative. When clocks go
  forward, a stated time may never have existed at all, and it says that too.
- **Coordinates near a timezone boundary are flagged.** County lines defeat
  coordinate lookups — the panel opens on Vevay, Indiana, precisely because that is
  a case the naive lookup gets wrong, which seemed a better default than one that
  flatters the implementation.
- **Which timezone database was used is recorded with every resolution.**
  Historical offsets are data, and that data is revised; a saved chart should not
  move because a timezone update shipped.
- **Leap seconds are handled where they exist**, from 1972, and deliberately not
  before, because UTC did not exist to have them.
- **The offset and the wall-clock time it applies to travel together** as one value,
  so no part of the app can be handed a mismatched pair and produce a confident
  wrong answer.
- Sixty-two tests cover this, and every expectation in them was measured against
  the ephemeris rather than written from memory. That caught three wrong
  assumptions, including one about how far the Ascendant actually moves, so the
  suite now pins the quantity that does advance uniformly — right ascension, at
  15.04 degrees an hour — rather than the one folklore says does.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-07

**Milestone M1 — delivery pipeline.**

Astraya is now something you can run, rather than something you have to build.
Still no charts: this release is about there being a trustworthy path from a commit
to a running application.

### Added

- **A Docker image**, `niqck/astraya`, for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.
  One image holds the application and the server that serves it — `docker run -p
8080:8080 niqck/astraya:latest` is the whole deployment.
- **An in-app changelog.** The version in the footer is a link; clicking it shows
  what changed in the build you are actually running, with no network request.
- **Published tags you can pin against** — `1.2.3`, `1.2`, `1` and `latest` for
  releases, `edge` for the main branch. A prerelease never moves `latest`.

### Notes on correctness

- Every published image is started and asked for its health endpoint before the
  build is called a success, and the served page is checked for its
  Content-Security-Policy header. An image that builds but cannot serve looks like
  a success, which makes it worse than a failure.
- The Content-Security-Policy is now defined in one place and asserted by a test to
  match between the served header and the page itself. Two copies drifting apart
  would silently weaken it.
- The changelog is rendered by a small Markdown subset renderer that cannot emit
  raw HTML, so it cannot become an injection sink later. A test renders the real
  changelog and fails if any entry is dropped — quietly losing a changelog line is
  worse than showing its syntax.
- Continuous integration and the release build now run the same Node version that
  the image ships, so the runtime that gates a release is the runtime that serves it.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-07

**Milestone M0 — foundation, licence and architecture.**

Astraya does not calculate charts for you yet. What this release establishes is
that the numbers it will produce are trustworthy, and that the ways they could go
quietly wrong are closed off.

### Added

- **Swiss Ephemeris integration**, arcsecond-accurate and running entirely in your
  browser. It executes in a Web Worker, so the interface never freezes while a
  chart is computed.
- **A correctness gate.** Positions are checked against reference values fetched
  from NASA JPL Horizons — 11 bodies across three epochs, agreeing to within 0.2
  arcseconds for historical dates. The suite runs offline, so it cannot be
  accidentally skipped.
- **An About page** carrying the licence, the source link for the exact build you
  are running, the Swiss Ephemeris attribution, and a plain-language statement of
  what Astraya stores and where.
- Continuous integration, a release process, and Renovate for dependency updates.

### Notes on correctness

Three ways to get silently wrong answers were found and closed:

- The Swiss Ephemeris type declarations state that the first house cusp is at array
  index 0. It is not. Following the documentation would have rotated **every
  chart** by one house — an error that looks entirely plausible on screen.
- Loading ephemeris data reports success even when individual data files fail,
  after which it quietly falls back to a lower-precision theory. Astraya now checks
  that every file actually loaded and refuses to compute otherwise.
- Around fourteen configuration flags are computed at runtime and untyped, so
  reading them from the declarations yields wrong values. They are now read from a
  live instance instead, and CI fails if they drift.

Dates outside 1800–2399 are refused with a clear message rather than answered with
degraded accuracy.

### Licence

Astraya is **AGPL-3.0-or-later**. This is required, not chosen: Swiss Ephemeris is
offered under either the AGPL or a commercial licence, and the AGPL cannot be
combined with MIT in this direction.
