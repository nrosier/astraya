# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# Astraya ships as a single image: the built SPA plus the Fastify process that
# serves it. One image rather than two, because the sync relay (M8) is another
# route on this same server — adding it later must not mean re-architecting how
# the app is deployed.
#
# Node 24 runs the server's TypeScript directly via built-in type stripping, so
# there is no server build step and no second toolchain in the runtime image.
#
# Everything the build produces — bundled JS, the SVG/CSS, the .se1 ephemeris
# files — is architecture-independent, so the build stages are pinned to
# $BUILDPLATFORM and run natively even for an arm64 target. Only the runtime
# layers are built per architecture. Multi-arch therefore costs one extra small
# `npm ci --omit=dev` under emulation instead of a full toolchain run.
#
# Base: Chainguard/Wolfi (glibc), not Alpine (musl). @node-rs/argon2 ships
# prebuilt native binaries per libc; glibc is what avoids the musl ABI class of
# problems entirely, and every stage below builds on it end to end so no
# musl-linked artifact ever meets a glibc runtime. Chainguard's free tier only
# publishes `latest`/`latest-dev` — there is no pinned-point-release tag to ARG
# in, unlike the old `node:24-alpine`. `-dev` (has npm, a shell, coreutils) for
# anything that installs or builds; the bare runtime tag for the final stage.
# The musl build is kept as Dockerfile.alpine for reference; it is not built by CI.

# The ops relay (server/ops/routes.ts) parses HLC timestamps using the client's

# Tier 2 (#360, server/interpretation-routes.ts) re-resolves each request's
# placementKeys against this server's own copy of the corpus, and runs the

# just as a UX nicety. Freeform mode's houseOf() call additionally reaches
# src/astrology/emphasis.ts, which itself makes a real value import of
# rulerOf() from dignities.ts (not just the `import type` it also has) — so
# dignities.ts is copied too, unlike src/ephemeris/types.ts below, which is
# only ever reached through `import type` and is erased by Node's type
# stripping before resolution is attempted. This is the full value-import
# closure that route actually reaches at runtime — now checked by
# `test/docker-runtime-files.test.ts` instead of traced by hand.

# Focus mode (#424, server/interpretation-routes.ts) validates its payload with
# `validateFocusContext`, which lives in focus-context-schema.ts and reads the
# reader's rulership choice from rulership.ts (#426). Both are static tables and
# pure functions with no calculation imports, which is why the schema is its own
# file rather than part of the builder. `test/docker-runtime-files.test.ts`
# computes the server's real runtime import closure and fails if any file in it
# is missing from this list, so a new server import cannot ship without its line.

# `data/` is the one writable path in the tree — it holds the SQLite file plus
# its WAL/SHM siblings (server/db.ts). Owned by UID:GID 1000, not Chainguard's
# own nonroot account (65532): existing deployments' `-v astraya-data:/app/data`
# (README) is a named volume already owned by 1000 from the Alpine `node` user,
# and there's no host bind-mount here to protect from UID collisions — so
# matching the old UID avoids forcing a chown migration on every deployment for
# no real benefit. A numeric USER doesn't need a passwd entry (Chainguard has
# none for 1000, only for its own 65532); Linux runs a process by UID whether or
# not a name resolves. USER root below is build-time only — chown to a UID
# other than the image's own default requires it — the USER after is what the
# running container actually gets.
