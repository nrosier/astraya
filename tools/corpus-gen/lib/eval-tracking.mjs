/**
 * Per-locale, per-entry evaluation-loop state for #381: without this, every run of
 * evaluate-corpus-batch.mjs re-checks the entire corpus from scratch, re-paying for (and
 * re-flagging) entries already judged clean in a prior pass. A plain JSON array, mirroring
 * corpus-feedback.mjs's own shape/identity convention, so it stays legible to inspect by hand
 * between runs.
 *
 * Two independent reasons an entry stops being re-evaluated:
 * - `clean: true` — evaluate-corpus-batch.mjs's own judge said this entry is correct. Set *only*
 *   there, never by improve-corpus-batch.mjs: a `verdict: 'UNCHANGED'` there means Gemini
 *   declined ChatGPT's complaint, not that the entry is confirmed fine — the two models
 *   disagreeing is a real "not clean" outcome, not a resolution, and #63's acceptance criteria
 *   treats it as exactly that (a small accepted residual, once the loop below exhausts).
 * - `evaluationCount >= limit` — the entry has gone through this many rounds of
 *   improve-corpus-batch.mjs (`IMPROVED` *or* `UNCHANGED` — either verdict consumes one
 *   iteration) without ever reaching `clean`, as many times as the feedback loop is allowed to
 *   run (default 2, see evaluate-corpus-batch.mjs's `--evaluation-limit`), so it stops being
 *   re-queued even though the two models never agreed.
 *
 * `lastRejection?: { issues, reasoning }` — set by improve-corpus-batch.mjs whenever its verdict
 * is `UNCHANGED` (Gemini's own `issues`-it-rejected and the `reasoning` it gave), cleared (never
 * set) on `IMPROVED` since a rewrite means any prior rejection no longer describes the current
 * text. evaluate-corpus-batch.mjs reads this back and hands it to its own judge on the entry's
 * next evaluation (`corpus-evaluation.mjs`'s `priorRejection`), so a disagreement between the two
 * models is visible to both sides across rounds instead of looping blind.
