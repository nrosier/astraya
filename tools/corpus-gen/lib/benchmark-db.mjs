/**
 * Persistence for benchmark-batch.mjs (#368 Part 3): what's already been
 * checked, and its score, so a re-run doesn't re-spend a Laya call (or an
 * astrologyapi.com call) on a placement that's already been verified unless
 * `--force` is passed.
 *
 * `node:sqlite`'s `DatabaseSync` — the same library `server/db.ts` already
 * uses (ships with Node, no new dependency) — but deliberately without that
 * file's migration-array/`PRAGMA user_version` machinery: this is a single
 * throwaway dev cache with a couple of tables, not a production database
 * with a history of shipped schemas to carry forward. If a table's shape
 * needs to change, deleting the file and letting it get recreated is the
 * expected fix, not a migration.
 *
 * Two tables, two different rules about third-party prose:
 *
 * - `benchmark_results` — no column holds astrologyapi.com's own prose,
 *   full stop. This is the durable, dashboard-facing history; #368's own
 *   no-redistribution constraint applies to it exactly as it applies to
 *   benchmark-batch.mjs's text report.
 * - `thirdparty_cache` — a deliberate, scoped exception, added on the
 *   user's own explicit request: while actively iterating on the judge
 *   itself (adding `all-minilm`, tuning thresholds, etc.), re-fetching the
 *   same placement's astrologyapi.com report on every run wastes real money
 *   and rate-limit budget for no reason. This table caches the raw response
 *   + extracted text per placement so a re-run can reuse it. Still
 *   local-only and gitignored (same `.data/` directory as everything else
 *   here), and the user's own instruction was explicit that this is
 *   temporary: `purgeThirdPartyCache()` (wired to `benchmark-batch.mjs
 *   --purge-thirdparty-cache`) is meant to be run once the judge itself is
 *   "solved and grounded" — not left running forever.
 *
 *   Second, later, equally explicit exception: `benchmark-dashboard.mjs`
 *   now reads this cache too, to show the third-party text next to
 *   Astraya's own in a per-row detail view — the user's own request, so
 *   they can actually read and compare the two, not just trust a score. The
 *   "never shown" half of #368's no-redistribution constraint bends here on
 *   purpose: the dashboard is a local, gitignored file, never committed and
 *   never reachable by an actual Astraya end user, which is the harm that
 *   constraint was written to prevent. The "never committed" and "never in
 *   the corpus" halves are untouched — `benchmark_results` itself still has
 *   no column for this text, and neither table is ever written to src/ or
 *   git.

/**

 *   production database. `thirdparty_cache` is a deliberate, scoped, user-requested exception to
 *   #368's no-redistribution constraint and is meant to be purged (purgeThirdPartyCache) once the
 *   judge itself is settled; `benchmark_results` never holds third-party prose at all.
