/**
 * Classical-source triage for #359, scoped to `dignity-state` only: checks a
 * corpus entry's text against a short excerpt from a real classical source
 * (William Lilly's *Christian Astrology*, 1647 — see
 * `classical-texts/dignity-state.en.json` for the excerpts and full
 * provenance) describing the same body in the same dignity state, and
 * additively tags any entry the judge finds substantively at odds with it
 * as `diverges-from-classical-source`. Same non-destructive, triage-not-gate
 * pattern as `verify.mjs`/`verify-batch.mjs`: never touches `reviewedBy`,
 * never deletes or rewrites `text`. A human reviewer for #292 makes the real
 * call; this only flags entries worth their attention.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow, like the fact-grounding judge: agreement in substance
 * (the same broad character — is this a flattering or unflattering portrait,
 * roughly the same traits?), not agreement in wording or tone. An entry is
 * allowed to be sarcastic about a trait Lilly describes gravely; it should
 * only be flagged if it describes the *opposite* character to what the classical source says for that state.

You are not an astrologer judging correctness in the abstract — you are checking substantive agreement between two texts about the same thing. Ignore differences in tone, era, vocabulary, persona voice (the modern entry may be sarcastic, clinical, or playful where the classical source is grave), and length. Judge only whether the modern entry's overall character portrait broadly agrees with the classical excerpt's — roughly the same traits, the same positive-or-negative valence — or whether it describes something substantively different or contradictory (for example, describing generosity and reliability for a state the classical source calls stubborn and stingy). Set matches=false only for a real substantive divergence, and list each one in issues (one plain-language sentence per array entry). If the entries broadly agree in substance, set matches=true and issues to an empty array.",
