/**
 * Feedback-loop revision prompt for #381: takes an entry evaluate-corpus-batch.mjs's independent
 * judge flagged, plus the judge's own specific issues, and asks the *same* model that originally
 * wrote the entry (Gemini) to revise it — critically, not automatically. The explicit ask (user's
 * own instruction, not inferred): "don't apply [the feedback] blindly, take what is useful." A
 * second opinion can itself be wrong — overly literal, nitpicking a stylistic choice, or simply
 * mistaken about the astrology — so the model that already knows this placement's facts and this
 * corpus's own house style is the right one to decide what's actually worth acting on, not a
 * script that applies every flagged issue unconditionally.
 *
 * Reuses `buildSystemInstruction`'s own voice/constraints (NEUTRAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
 * NEGATIVE_CONSTRAINTS, VOICE_GUIDE) as the base, so a revision reads like it came from the same
 * house style as every other entry — this is additional instruction on top of that, not a
 * separate voice.
 *
 * `lastResort` (#396's quintile/biquintile stragglers): a real, recurring deadlock surfaced by
 * the feedback loop once it reaches entries exhausted at `--evaluation-limit` without agreement —
 * the judge keeps asking for this specific minor aspect's own distinctive flavor, and Gemini keeps
 * declining on the grounds that NEGATIVE_CONSTRAINTS forbids aspect jargon, for placements (often
 * obscure bodies — Lilith variants, nodes, Vesta) where there may be no way to signal
 * distinctiveness in pure psychological prose alone. User's own explicit, narrowly-scoped
 * exception: allowed only as a true last resort, only for entries that already exhausted the
 * normal two-round loop disagreeing. improve-corpus-batch.mjs's own `--last-resort` mode is the
 * only caller that ever sets this.
