/**
 * Language-quality judge prompt: catches what lint.ts's `language-mismatch`
 * rule structurally can't — that rule only checks whether an entry contains
 * at least one of its locale's common words, so it misses an entry that is
 * mostly-correct prose with a stray word or phrase from another language
 * mixed in, a spelling mistake, or phrasing a native speaker would never
 * produce, as long as a handful of ordinary function words are still
 * present. Those need an actual reader, not a keyword count.
 *
 * Three-way verdict, not fact-grounding's two-way grounded/not: a wrong
 * language or an ambiguous problem (BAD) needs a human decision (remove and
 * regenerate), but a clear, mechanical slip — a typo, a Dutch d/t-fout, a
 * missing standard punctuation mark — can be corrected right here instead of
 * costing a regeneration cycle (FIXED). GOOD means exactly what it says: no
 * change made. Confidence-gated deliberately high (per the rubric below) so
 * FIXED never means "rewrote this to sound better" — rule 3 explicitly bans
 * that — only "corrected an unambiguous mechanical error."
 *
 * One rubric, not one hand-written-and-translated rubric per locale (as a
 * `verify.mjs`-style `RUBRIC[locale]` lookup would be): instructions in
 * English about a named target language work fine for any locale a model
 * already knows, and the corpus already supports locales beyond today's
 * en/nl. A per-locale lookup would need a human to add and translate a new
 * block for every future locale, and silently judging an unknown locale
 * against the wrong language's rubric (the obvious fallback) is worse than
 * no check at all.
 *
 * Validated against gemini-3.5-flash-lite and gemini-3.8-flash with 6
 * hand-picked cases (clean text, an obvious typo, valid-but-unusual style
 * that must NOT be rewritten, a classic Dutch d/t-fout, wrong-language text,
 * and word-salad nonsense): both scored 6/6, flash-lite with zero thinking
 * tokens against 3.8-flash's ~900 for the same 6 calls. flash-lite is the
 * one actually wired up as this script's default for that reason — see
 * language-quality-batch.mjs.
