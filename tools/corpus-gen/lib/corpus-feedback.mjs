/**
 * Per-locale feedback file read/write for #381's two-stage loop: evaluate-corpus-batch.mjs
 * writes to this file, improve-corpus-batch.mjs reads from it. A plain JSON array, not keyed by
 * an object map, so it stays simple to inspect by hand (`jq`, a text editor) between the two
 * stages — this is meant to be a legible artifact, not just internal plumbing.
 *
 * Identity is the entry's `key`, matching the corpus's own dedupe identity (schema.ts/loader.ts).
 * `upsertFeedback` replaces an existing record for the same identity rather than duplicating it,
 * so re-running evaluate-corpus-batch.mjs after a prior pass updates stale feedback instead of
 * piling up repeats.
