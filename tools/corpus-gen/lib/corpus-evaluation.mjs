/**
 * Second-opinion evaluation rubric for #381: unlike verify.mjs's own fact-grounding judge (a
 * narrow mechanical check — does the text name a wrong body/sign/house/aspect/dignity? — by
 * design indifferent to writing quality or psychological depth), this rubric also asks whether
 * the entry actually captures *this specific placement*, or defaults to a generic trope that
 * would fit many other placements just as well, or a shadow framed as an extreme emotional
 * symptom rather than a specific functional tension — the same failure mode #379/#380's own
 * prompt-engineering work (NEUTRAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT, VOICE_GUIDE) exists to prevent at generation
 * time. This is that same quality bar, applied after the fact by an independent model, instead
 * of only trusted to the generator's own prompt.
 *
 * Validated empirically against gpt-5-nano, gpt-5.4-nano, gpt-5.6-luna and gpt-6-luna with 6
 * hand-picked cases (a correct entry, a wrong-dignity entry, a Saturn cliché-shadow entry, a
 * correct functional-tension entry, a wrong-sign entry, a generic Mars trope): gpt-6-luna and
 * gpt-5.6-luna both scored 6/6; gpt-5-nano also scored 6/6 but used 10-14x more completion
 * tokens for the same answers (erasing its lower per-token price); gpt-5.4-nano scored only 4/6
 * (two false positives against genuinely fine entries). gpt-6-luna is the one actually wired up
 * as this feature's default — see evaluate-corpus-batch.mjs's own doc comment.
 *
 * `priorRejection` closes the loop the other direction: when improve-corpus-batch.mjs's judge
 * (Gemini, the model that wrote the entry) reviews a flagged entry and rejects the complaint
 * (verdict UNCHANGED), that rejection — the issues it rejected and its own reasoning for doing
 * so — is handed back to *this* judge on the entry's next evaluation
 * (evaluate-corpus-batch.mjs reads it from eval-tracking.mjs's `lastRejection`), so ChatGPT is
 * reviewing with the full back-and-forth in view, not re-flagging the same thing in a loop with
 * neither side ever seeing the other's reasoning.
 *
 * `VARIANT_BODY_NOTE` (#395): a real, recurring disagreement surfaced by the above loop, not a
 * hypothetical one — meanLilith/trueLilith/osculatingLilith/interpolatedLilith and meanNode/
 * trueNode are different *calculation methods* for one real point (the Moon's apogee, or its
 * orbital node), not different astrological significators; no tradition assigns them distinct
 * psychological meaning, and the app offers them as a mutually-exclusive user setting — a reader
 * only ever sees whichever one they picked, never two side by side. ChatGPT was repeatedly
 * flagging these entries as generic/interchangeable precisely because sibling variants *do* read
 * near-identically, which is correct, not a defect — and Gemini was repeatedly (correctly)
 * rejecting that complaint, citing the house style's jargon ban as the reason it couldn't
 * differentiate them, which was the right instinct for the wrong-sounding reason: there's nothing
 * true to differentiate, with or without jargon. This note gives the judge that fact up front
 * instead of relitigating it per entry.
