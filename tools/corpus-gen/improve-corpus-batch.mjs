/**
 * #381 stage 2 of 2: reads a locale's feedback file (evaluate-corpus-batch.mjs's own output —
 * ChatGPT's second opinion on flagged entries) and asks Gemini, the model that originally wrote
 * each entry, to critically review that feedback and revise only what it agrees is a genuine
 * problem — not apply it unconditionally. See lib/corpus-improvement.mjs's own doc comment for
 * why: a second opinion can itself be wrong, so the model that already knows this placement's
 * facts and this corpus's own house style is the one in a position to judge what's actually
 * worth acting on.
 *
 * An IMPROVED verdict replaces the entry's `text` in place and tags it
 * `improved-via-feedback-loop`, same non-destructive-tag convention
 * language-quality-batch.mjs's own FIXED verdict uses — provenance.model/generatedAt are left
 * alone (they record who originally wrote the text; this revises it, it doesn't re-attribute
 * it). An UNCHANGED verdict touches nothing. Either way the record is removed from the feedback
 * file once processed — reasoning is printed to the console as it happens, which is the audit
 * trail for a run; nothing is held onto needing a second pass once a record has been decided.
 *
 * Also updates tools/corpus-gen/eval-tracking/<locale>.json (lib/eval-tracking.mjs), the state
 * evaluate-corpus-batch.mjs reads to decide what still needs checking: every verdict here —
 * IMPROVED or UNCHANGED — consumes one feedback-loop iteration (`evaluationCount += 1`). An
 * UNCHANGED verdict is Gemini declining ChatGPT's complaint, not confirming the entry clean, so
 * it does *not* mark the entry clean — the two models disagreeing is exactly the "not clean"
 * outcome #63's acceptance criteria expects a small residual percentage of once the loop
 * exhausts (`--evaluation-limit`, default 2), not something resolved on the first disagreement.
 * `clean` is only ever set by evaluate-corpus-batch.mjs's own judge actually agreeing an entry is
 * correct, never by this script declining a rewrite.
 *
 * Prints an estimated total cost on completion, from each result's own token usage
 * (`usageMetadata`, including `thoughtsTokenCount` — Gemini bills thinking tokens as output,
 * confirmed against a real response) and lib/cost-estimate.mjs's batch-tier pricing table — an
 * estimate for visibility, not a billing record.
 *
 * Always batch mode (Gemini), reusing lib/gemini-batch.mjs — the same client
 * generate-batch.mjs's own --batch and language-quality-batch.mjs's --batch already use.
 *
 * Submit-and-exit, not submit-and-block: a batch job can legitimately take Gemini up to its own
 * 48-hour hard expiry, so this script never sits in a poll loop. Every run first checks every job
 * already recorded in tools/corpus-gen/batch-state/improve-<locale>.json — a *list*, since more
 * than one batch can be in flight for the same locale at once. For each: a still-running job is
 * reported and left on the list; a finished one has its results retrieved and applied (same as
 * before), then drops off the list. Whatever's left genuinely eligible in the feedback file after
 * that — with anything a still-running job already covers subtracted out, so the same flagged
 * entry is never reviewed by two jobs at once — is submitted as a new batch (unless
 * `--check-only` is passed, which only checks/applies and never submits). Run the script again
 * (same `--locale`) whenever it's convenient to check.
 *
 * `--check-only` without `--locale` widens this to every locale that has a batch-state file at
 * all: it scans tools/corpus-gen/batch-state/improve-*.json, reports which locale has which
 * batch running (and still applies any that happen to have finished), without needing to know in
 * advance which locale(s) you're waiting on. `--locale` stays required for every other mode,
 * since submitting a new batch always has to be against one specific locale's feedback/corpus.
 *
 *   npx tsx --env-file=.env.local tools/corpus-gen/improve-corpus-batch.mjs --locale=en [--limit=N] [--model=<name>] [--check-only]
 *   npx tsx --env-file=.env.local tools/corpus-gen/improve-corpus-batch.mjs --check-only   (checks every locale with a batch in flight)
