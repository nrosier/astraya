/**
 * Fixed chart pool for benchmark-batch.mjs (#368 Part 3): astrologyapi.com's
 * report endpoints take a real birth chart, not an arbitrary placement — you
 * can't ask it for "Sun in Leo" directly, only "Sun's sign report for this
 * chart" (whatever sign that turns out to be). Rather than searching for a
 * chart that happens to produce a specific target placement, this computes a
 * handful of fixed charts and samples from whatever placements they
 * actually contain, guaranteeing the astrologyapi.com report call and
 * Astraya's text describe the exact same placement.
 *
 * Originally planned to compute these charts with Astraya's own engine
 * (`src/domain/chart-compute.ts`), but `src/ephemeris/assets.ts` reads
 * `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` at module load time, which only exists under
 * Vite/Vitest — no script or server code in this repo runs the ephemeris
 * engine outside those two today, and a plain tsx script crashes on import.
 * Per the user's own call, this instead derives each fixed chart's real
 * positions/houses from astrologyapi.com itself — sidesteps the Vite/WASM
 * boundary entirely, and grounds both sides of the benchmark in the same
 * vendor computation for that call. Sign/house/aspect derivation still runs
 * through Astraya's own pure math (`signIndex`, `houseOf`, `findAspects` —
 * none of which touch the ephemeris engine), only the raw longitudes are
 * borrowed from the vendor.
 *
 * `western_horoscope` — the single combined call originally used here — is
 * **currently broken on astrologyapi.com's own server** (confirmed against a
 * real account/key on the first real run of this tool, 2026-09-30):
 * every call returns HTTP 200 with an internal Lambda crash as the body
 * ("Cannot find module '../locale/[wildcard]/msg'", /var/task/calc/western.js) —
 * a vendor-side packaging bug, reproduced 3x with different parameters and
 * independently by this project's own astrology MCP tool integration. Two
 * separate endpoints, `planets/tropical` and `house_cusps/tropical`, return
 * the same underlying data without going through that broken code path, and
 * their exact response shape was captured directly (not guessed) against
 * that same account: a bare array of `{name, fullDegree, speed, sign,
 * house}` for the former, `{houses: [{house, sign, degree}], ascendant,
 * midheaven, vertex}` for the latter. If `western_horoscope` gets fixed
 * server-side, switching back is a one-line change (see `fetchChart` below);
 * until then, this file never calls it.
 *
 * Restricted to the 7 traditional planets: only Sun was pilot-verified
 * against astrologyapi.com's sign/house report endpoints, and astrologyapi.com
 * is a Vedic-oriented vendor unlikely to support outer planets/nodes/Lilith/
 * asteroids on those specific report endpoints. A report call that 4xxs for
 * an unsupported body is the caller's problem to skip, not assumed clean here.
