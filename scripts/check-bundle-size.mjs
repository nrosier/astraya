/**
 * Bundle-size gate for the production build (#73).
 *
 * What is measured is the **eager graph**: the entry chunk plus every chunk it reaches
 * through a static import, which is exactly the set a first-time visitor downloads before
 * anything renders. Measuring the entry chunk alone was right while it was nearly the whole
 * app, and became misleading once the screens were split out (#338) — splitting a module out
 * of `index-*.js` into a chunk that `index-*.js` still statically imports shrinks the entry
 * chunk while changing nothing a visitor experiences.
 *
 * Alongside the budget, each thing that is supposed to be lazy is asserted to be *reachable
 * only* dynamically: the Swiss Ephemeris WASM engine (~570 KiB), the per-screen chart modules
 * and the admin panel (#338). Those assertions are what actually verify "lazy-loaded" —
 * replace a dynamic `import()` with a static one and the chunk lands in the eager graph,
 * which fails here with a message that names the cause rather than just a number that grew.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs
 *
 * Run after `npm run build`, against dist/assets/.
