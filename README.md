</p>

A genuine astrological calculation and charting application. You enter a birth
date, time and place; Astraya computes the chart and draws it.

The emphasis is on being _correct_. Positions come from the Swiss Ephemeris, and
the test suite checks them against reference values fetched from NASA JPL
Horizons rather than values written from memory. Where a calculation is undefined
— Placidus houses inside the polar circles, Chiron outside its validity window, a
date outside the shipped ephemeris range — Astraya says so instead of returning a
plausible-looking number.

## Status

Pre-1.0 (`v0.27.0`). Calculation, charting, interpretation (including optional
AI-customized restyling), and sync are all built and shipping; M9 (polish and
the `v1.0.0` launch itself) is what's left — see the
[issues and milestones](https://github.com/nrosier/astraya/issues) for what is
planned and what is done.

## What it does

- **Natal charts** — all bodies, roughly 23 house systems, 48 ayanamsas, tropical
  and sidereal, aspects, dignities, derived points, nakshatras.
- **Progressions and returns** — secondary, solar-arc and tertiary progressions;
  solar, lunar and planetary returns; bi-wheels.
- **Interpretation** — a full written report. The prose corpus is drafted by an
  LLM **at build time** and committed as source data; the shipped application
  makes no model API calls, ever.

## Design

- **Local-first.** The authoritative copy of your data lives in your browser, in
  IndexedDB. Calculation and charting are entirely client-side, so the app works
  offline as its normal mode rather than as a degraded one.
- **Optional sync.** Signing in (Authentik OIDC) syncs an append-only operation
  log to your own self-hosted server so your data reaches your other devices. The
  server stores opaque operations and never interprets them. Without signing in,
  nothing leaves your device.

## Development

Requires Node 24 or newer.

```sh
npm install
npm run ephe:sync    # copy + verify the Swiss Ephemeris data files
npm run corpus:split # split the interpretation corpus into runtime chunks
npm run dev
npm run check        # format, lint, typecheck, test
```

`npm run ephe:sync` copies four files (2.48 MB) out of the 110 MB `sweph-wasm`
package, plus fetches a fifth (`sefstars.txt`, the fixed-stars catalog, over
HTTPS from the Swiss Ephemeris project itself — not part of the npm package),
into `public/ephe/` and verifies each against a pinned SHA-256. It fails loudly
if upstream repacks them, because a silently different ephemeris file is a
silently different chart.

`npm run corpus:split` splits `src/interpretation/corpus/{en,nl}.json` into
one file per locale under `public/corpus/`, so the app fetches
only the interpretation text a reader can actually see instead of the entire
corpus. Re-run it whenever those source files change.

## Try it

A static, no-server demo build runs at
<https://nrosier.github.io/astraya/>. It's the same client — calculation,
charting and the report all run in your browser exactly as below — but built in
a `demo` mode with sign-in and sync disabled entirely, since GitHub Pages has no
server to have an account on. Nothing you enter there ever leaves your device.

## Running it

A single image serves the built application; there is nothing else to deploy.

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v astraya-data:/app/data niqck/astraya:latest
```

Then open <http://localhost:8080>. It works offline once loaded, and needs no
configuration — calculation happens in your browser, and no account is required.
Images are published for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`; see
[docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) for the tagging scheme.

The `-v` mount is only needed if you sign in: it's where the container keeps
accounts and sessions. Without it, that data is lost the moment the container
is removed — everything else about the app, run with no volume at all, still
works exactly the same.

`PORT` (default `8080`), `HOST`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `ASTRAYA_DB_PATH` and
`ASTRAYA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` are the only required settings. Local sign-in is
optional; the container logs a one-time setup link on first boot if you want
an account.

If `ASTRAYA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` ever leaks, it can be rotated: stop the server and
run `npm run ops:rotate-key` with `ASTRAYA_NEW_ENCRYPTION_KEY` set to the
replacement, which re-encrypts every stored operation in one transaction, then
start again with `ASTRAYA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` set to the new key. Changing the
variable without that step leaves the existing rows undecryptable — see
[`.env.example`](.env.example).

### Optional: sign-in with Authentik

Astraya's own username/password accounts work with no further setup. To let
people sign in with an existing Authentik identity instead (or as well), set
`ASTRAYA_OIDC_ISSUER`, `ASTRAYA_OIDC_CLIENT_ID` and `ASTRAYA_PUBLIC_URL` (see
[`.env.example`](.env.example) for the exact meaning of each). In the
Authentik provider:

- Create a public OAuth2/OIDC provider — no client secret; Astraya uses the
  Authorization Code flow with PKCE and never holds a secret.
- Set its redirect URI to exactly `${ASTRAYA_PUBLIC_URL}/auth/oidc/callback`.
- Set its RP-initiated logout redirect (sign-out redirect) to exactly
  `${ASTRAYA_PUBLIC_URL}`, so signing out of Astraya also ends the Authentik
  session rather than leaving it active.

Signing in with Authentik provisions a new local Astraya account on first use
(never an admin — grant that separately, see below) and, from then on, works exactly like
a local account: same session cookie, same sync relay, same sign-out flow.
Astraya has no way to notice an account disabled or a session revoked on the
Authentik side after the initial sign-in exchange, so Authentik-derived
sessions use a shorter TTL (24h, vs. 30 days for local accounts) to bound how
long that gap can last.

#### Making Authentik group members admins or super admins

There are two levels of administrator (#431): an **admin** can use every admin
screen but cannot create, change or delete accounts; a **super admin** can do
everything, including granting and removing either role. Set
`ASTRAYA_OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS` and/or `ASTRAYA_OIDC_SUPER_ADMIN_GROUPS` to
comma-separated lists of Authentik group names (matched exactly, case included,
e.g. `ASTRAYA_OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS=astraya_admin`). Anyone in one of those groups is
given the role each time they sign in (a member of both is a super admin);
nobody is ever demoted automatically. Local accounts have the matching
`ASTRAYA_ADMIN_USERNAMES` and `ASTRAYA_SUPER_ADMIN_USERNAMES`. Two things have
to be true for this to work:

- **The server has to actually see the variable.** The Node server reads only
  its process environment — it does not look for a `.env` file by itself. Pass
  one explicitly (`node --env-file=.env server/index.ts`), or give the container
  an `env_file`/`-e` for it. The server logs a one-line note at start-up saying
  which groups it will promote, or warning when the variable is set but OIDC
  is not configured.
- **The ID token has to carry the group list.** Astraya reads the `groups`
  claim (change it with `ASTRAYA_OIDC_ADMIN_GROUP_CLAIM`). In Authentik, make
  sure the provider's scopes include a mapping that emits it — the default
  `profile` scope mapping does on a standard install; a custom one may not.

Each OIDC sign-in logs which groups the token carried and whether any matched,
so if promotion doesn't happen, the server log says why.

Admins get an **Admin** tab in the main menu with the user list (read-only, with
each account's role), AI usage, and the corpus review screens. Super admins also
get the controls that create, change the role of, disable, reset the password of,
and delete accounts. The first account created at setup is a super admin; the
last usable super admin cannot be demoted, disabled or deleted, and nobody can
change their own role.

### Optional: a geocoding provider that doesn't need a referrer

The birth-place picker's "Search for a place by name" field needs no setup
either: by default it queries Nominatim's public forward-geocoding endpoint,
no API key required. Nominatim only grants CORS to requests carrying a
`Referer`, so this request overrides this server's blanket
`Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` for itself, disclosing this site's origin to
Nominatim (nothing more). It's also subject to
[Nominatim's usage policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/),
which blocks clients that don't identify themselves or that exceed its
limits — a real deployment's traffic is expected to eventually trip that.

The lower-effort fix is a free [MapTiler](https://cloud.maptiler.com/account/keys/)
API key: set `VITE_MAPTILER_API_KEY` (see [`.env.example`](.env.example)).
MapTiler's Geocoding API authenticates by that key, not by `Referer`, so no
referrer is ever sent and the usage-policy risk doesn't apply.

A MapTiler key is therefore **public by construction**: the browser has to send
it to MapTiler, so it is readable in the shipped JavaScript and in the network
tab by anyone who loads the app. That is inherent to browser-side geocoding,
not a leak — but it does mean the key needs a restriction rather than
secrecy. Restrict it by referrer/domain in the
[MapTiler console](https://cloud.maptiler.com/account/keys/) to the origins you
serve Astraya from, so someone who copies it out of the bundle cannot spend your
quota from their own site.

To serve lookups from your own Nominatim-compatible server instead, set
`VITE_NOMINATIM_URL` and `ASTRAYA_GEOCODE_ORIGIN` to matching values (see
[`.env.example`](.env.example)) — this takes priority over a MapTiler key if
both are set. The two must describe the same origin: a mismatch fails
closed, blocking the lookup rather than allowing the wrong host through.

Unlike the server-runtime variables above, `VITE_NOMINATIM_URL` and
`VITE_MAPTILER_API_KEY` are baked into the client bundle at build time, so
neither can be changed by setting it on an already-built container — rebuild
the image with it set instead.

### Optional: serving from a subpath

Set `VITE_BASE_PATH` (e.g. `/Astraya/`) when the app is served from something
other than the domain root, such as a GitHub Pages project site — this is how
the demo build above gets served from `/Astraya/` rather than `/`. Like the
tile variables above, it's baked in at build time; see
[`.env.example`](.env.example) for the exact requirements (leading and
trailing slashes).

Which of the four build modes (`development`/`production`/`test`/`demo`) a
build uses, and which npm script selects each, is also documented in
[`.env.example`](.env.example).

### Optional: behind a reverse proxy

By default the server trusts none of `X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Forwarded-Proto` —
correct when it's reachable directly, but it means every request looks like it
came from the proxy's own IP, and a cookie never gets marked `Secure` even over
HTTPS. If you do run one in front of Astraya, set `ASTRAYA_TRUST_PROXY` to a
list of the proxy's own IPs/CIDRs (e.g. `127.0.0.1` for one on the same host)
— see [`.env.example`](.env.example). Leave it unset otherwise: trusting those
headers from a client that isn't actually behind your proxy lets it spoof its
own IP and dodge per-route rate limiting.

## Licence

**AGPL-3.0-or-later.** Astraya links the Swiss Ephemeris, which Astrodienst AG
licenses under either the AGPL or a commercial licence; the AGPL is the option
taken here, and it is why Astraya cannot be MIT. See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and
[`NOTICE`](NOTICE) for the full terms and the required attributions.

If you run a modified Astraya as a network service, the AGPL obliges you to offer
its users the corresponding source. The `/about` page carries that link.
