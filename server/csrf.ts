/**
 * Origin checking, as defence in depth behind `SameSite=Lax` (#329).
 *
 * Cross-site request forgery is already blocked twice over: the session cookie is
 * `sameSite: 'lax'`, which suppresses it on any cross-site write, and Fastify's default
 * body parser rejects `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, which is the only body type a
 * plain HTML form can send. Both of those are good defences. Neither is *ours*: the first
 * is the browser's promise and the second is a library default that a future content-type
 * parser could quietly widen. This module is the check that does not depend on either.
 *
 * Deliberately not a CSRF token. A token needs somewhere to live, which for a local-first
 * app with no server-rendered HTML means another cookie plus a header on every write, and
 * it would protect exactly the requests an origin check already protects. The cost is not
 * the code, it is the extra piece of session state that can desynchronise and lock a
 * signed-in user out of their own data.
 *
 * **Absent `Origin` is allowed.** Browsers omit it on same-origin navigations, and `curl`
 * and the test suite never send it, so requiring it would reject legitimate clients while
 * adding nothing: the attack this guards against is a *browser* making a cross-site write,
 * and browsers always send `Origin` on a write.
