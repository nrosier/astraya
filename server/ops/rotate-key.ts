 * @conventions Not exposed as an admin HTTP route on purpose — it holds both the old and new key and rewrites every row, which belongs to an operator with shell/container access, not a session cookie. Rotates the key material only, never `CURRENT_KEY_VERSION` (the encryption scheme itself, AES-256-GCM, is unchanged); re-encryption runs in one transaction, failing before writing anything if any row does not decrypt under the stated current key, so a wrong key never produces a half-rotated database.
