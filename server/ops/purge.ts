/**
 * Server-side half of a purge (#308): a deny-list of already-erased entities, and the

 *
 * A deliberate, narrow exception to ADR 0002's "opaque relay" framing, in the same
 * category `deletion-impact.ts` and `corpus_overrides` already are: at push time
 * `server/ops/routes.ts` already holds each op's *plaintext* in hand, transiently, right
 * before encrypting it for storage, so detecting a purge marker there costs nothing
 * beyond a `JSON.parse` of bytes already in memory — no new decryption capability.
 * Erasing rows already written to disk, though, does need to decrypt at-rest ciphertext,
 * exactly as `deletion-impact.ts`'s preview already does.

/**
 * @module purge
 * @purpose Server-side right-to-erasure support: records a permanent per-user deny-list of purged `(entity, entityId)` pairs and erases their already-stored op rows the moment a purge marker op lands.
 * @conventions Another deliberate, narrow exception to ADR 0002's opaque-relay rule, in the same category as `deletion-impact.ts`: push-time parsing of an op's plaintext body costs nothing extra, since `server/ops/routes.ts` already holds that plaintext transiently right before encrypting it, but erasing already-written rows does require decrypting at-rest ciphertext. The purge marker's own row is preserved (matched by its `hlc`) so a later pull still tells every device the entity is gone.
