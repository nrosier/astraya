/**
 * The Content Security Policy, defined once.
 *
 * It is served two ways: as a real header by this server, and as a `<meta>` tag in
 * `index.html` so the policy still applies when the built app is hosted as static
 * files. Those two must not drift, so `test/csp.test.ts` asserts the meta tag
 * matches this value — the earlier plan's mistake was to write the policy twice
 * and tighten it later.
 *
 * `connect-src 'self'` is the load-bearing directive. Astraya's interpretation
 * corpus is drafted by an LLM at build time and committed as data; the shipped app
 * must never reach a model provider. This makes that structural rather than a
 * promise. The browser never fetches the OIDC issuer directly either — discovery
 * is resolved server-side (`server/auth/oidc.ts`) and handed to the client, partly
 * because that keeps this guarantee intact and partly because the issuer's
 * discovery endpoint cannot be relied on to send CORS headers a browser fetch would
 * need. `connect-src` therefore stays `'self'` even with OIDC configured.
 *
 * `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` is required to compile the Swiss Ephemeris WebAssembly
 * module. It permits WASM compilation only, not `eval` of JavaScript.
 *
 * `img-src`'s `blob:` is for PNG chart export: `chart-raster.ts` rasterizes a
 * chart's SVG by loading it into an `<img>` from a `blob:` URL before drawing
 * it to a canvas.
 *
 * `connect-src`'s one exception to `'self'` is Nominatim's geocoding host
 * (#290, #291): `BirthPlaceSearch.tsx`'s "Search for a place by name" field
 * turns a typed place name into coordinates via a `fetch()` to
 * `nominatim.openstreetmap.org` by default. Kept as its own `geocodeOrigin`
 * config field so a self-hoster can point it at their own server instead.
