/**
 * The live store: the one object the UI talks to.
 *
 * Everything underneath this file is pure — the log is a value, the fold is a function,
 * the clock is a value with a `tick`. That is deliberate, and this module is where the
 * impurity is concentrated instead of being spread through the UI: opening the database,
 * generating a device id once, writing records, and telling React that something changed.
 *
 * Three rules it exists to enforce:
 *
 *  1. **The log is the authority.** State is always a fold of records, never edited in
 *     place. A screen showing a person that no record produced is a bug with nowhere to
 *     hide, because there is only one way state is ever computed.
 *  2. **Mutations are serialised.** `Log` is an immutable value threaded through `append`,
 *     so two overlapping mutations that both start from the same log would produce two
 *     next-logs and one of them would be lost. The queue below is what makes that
 *     impossible rather than unlikely.
 *  3. **A record reaches the database before the UI is told it happened.** The alternative
 *     is an interface that reports a saved person the store does not have.
 */

/**
 * @module store/store
 * @purpose Assembles the IndexedDB layer, the op-log, the fold and the HLC clock into the single `Store` object the UI talks to — the one place in the stack where impurity (database I/O, device id generation, change notification) is concentrated.
 * @conventions State is always a fold of records, never edited in place; mutations are serialised through a tail-promise queue because the in-memory `Log` is an immutable value read at the start of a mutation and written at the end, so overlapping mutations would race; a record is written durably before the UI is ever told it happened; snapshots are rewritten only every `SNAPSHOT_EVERY` records and best-effort on failure, since a snapshot is only a cache and `resume` can always rebuild; a purge (#308) commits its `PURGED_FIELD` marker through the ordinary fold path first, then physically strips the entity's other records from the log and database.
