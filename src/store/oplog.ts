/**
 * The append-only operation log.
 *
 * This is the authoritative copy of a user's data. People and charts are not stored;
 * they are *derived* by folding this log (#95), which is what makes merging two
 * devices tractable — merging state requires deciding what to do about a conflict,
 * whereas merging logs is a union.
 *
 * The log is a value that is threaded through, not module state, for the same reason
 * the clock is: two logs must be able to coexist in one process so that a test can
 * play two devices against each other, and no test may depend on the order the others
 * ran in. Persistence (#93) and sync (M8) wrap this; neither is imported here, so the
 * merge rules can be tested without a database or a network.
 *
 * The timestamp is the primary key. An HLC contains the writing device and a
 * per-device counter, so it is globally unique by construction — which is what makes
 * re-sending an operation harmless, and what makes two *different* operations sharing
 * one timestamp a fault rather than a conflict to resolve.
 *
 * Records are kept sorted by timestamp, and that sort is the merge: because the
 * encoding is lexicographically ordered, the union of two logs sorted by timestamp is
 * the same sequence on both devices regardless of when each learned of what. That
 * property is what the fold relies on to be deterministic, so it is asserted here
 * rather than assumed downstream.
 */

/**
 * @module store/oplog
 * @purpose Implements the append-only operation log itself: appending local mutations, merging a peer's records, and querying/purging the log — the structure the fold materialises state from.
 * @conventions The log is an immutable value threaded through by the caller, not module state, so multiple logs can coexist in one process for testing; records are kept sorted by HLC timestamp so merging two logs is just a union; a record from a newer client is stored unread rather than dropped, since this device may be the only route by which it reaches another peer; two different operations claiming the same timestamp is treated as corruption, never silently resolved by picking one.
