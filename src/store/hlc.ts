/**
 * Hybrid logical clocks.
 *
 * Every operation in the log carries one of these, and field-level last-write-wins
 * resolves conflicts by comparing them. So this module decides which of two edits
 * survives, which makes it the most consequential file in the store.
 *
 * A hybrid logical clock is a physical millisecond reading, a counter for events
 * inside the same millisecond, and the id of the device that stamped it. It gives us
 * two things a plain `Date.now()` cannot:
 *
 * 1. **Monotonicity per device.** Wall clocks go backwards — NTP corrections, a
 *    laptop resuming from sleep, a user changing the date. A timestamp that goes
 *    backwards makes an older edit win, permanently. The logical part never
 *    decreases, whatever the physical clock does.
 * 2. **A total order across devices.** Two devices editing offline produce
 *    timestamps that must order deterministically or the two devices materialise
 *    different state from the same log. The device id breaks ties, so the order is
 *    total rather than merely partial.
 *
 * What it deliberately does *not* fix is a device whose clock is genuinely wrong —
 * a phone set a year ahead stamps operations a year ahead, and wins every conflict
 * until real time catches up. No client-side clock can detect that about itself, so
 * the server stamps its own receive time and rejects implausible skew (#105). What
 * this module does is *notice* when a peer's timestamp is far ahead of ours and say
 * so, because adopting it is required for convergence but should not be silent.
 *
 * The clock is a value that callers thread through, not module state. Hidden mutable
 * state here would make tests order-dependent and make two stores in one process
 * (which is exactly what a sync test needs) interfere.
 */

/**
 * @module store/hlc
 * @purpose Implements the hybrid logical clock used to timestamp every operation in the log, giving the op-log a total, causally-consistent order across devices that resolves last-write-wins conflicts.
 * @conventions Timestamps are fixed-width strings (`millis-counter-nodeId`) so lexicographic string comparison equals causal order, which every string-sorted or string-keyed read in the store relies on; the logical counter never decreases even if the physical clock goes backwards; the device id breaks ties so ordering is total rather than merely partial; a peer's clock being implausibly far ahead is only reported, never rejected client-side, since only the server is positioned to judge genuine clock skew (#105).

 * A timestamp, encoded so that lexicographic string order *is* causal order.
 *
 * `000001749427200000-00000-a1b2c3d4e5f60718`
 *
 * The encoding is load-bearing rather than cosmetic. IndexedDB compares keys, the
 * operation log is read in order, and sync asks for "everything after this cursor" —
 * all of which are string comparisons if the format is fixed-width. Comparing parsed
 * structs instead would mean every one of those paths needs the parser to agree, and
 * a fixed-width string cannot disagree with itself.
 *
 * Field widths matter for a specific reason: the moment a field needs one more digit
 * than its padding, the sort order breaks, and it breaks quietly — a longer number
 * sorts *after* a shorter one only by accident of the digits. So both numeric fields
 * are padded far wider than they can plausibly need. 18 digits of milliseconds
 * reaches beyond the year 33000 (13 would run out in 2286), and 5 digits of counter
 * allow 100,000 events inside a single millisecond. The device id is fixed-width so
 * the tiebreak between two devices cannot depend on how long their ids happen to be.
