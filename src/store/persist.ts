/**
 * Ask the browser not to throw the user's data away (#98).
 *
 * For a user who never signs in, IndexedDB holds the *only* copy of every person and
 * chart they have entered. Browsers are entitled to evict an origin's storage under
 * disk pressure, and Safari clears it outright after roughly seven days without a
 * visit. Neither shows the user a warning; the app simply comes back empty.
 *
 * `navigator.storage.persist()` asks for exemption. What the answer means is not
 * uniform, which is why this module reports a status rather than a boolean:
 *
 *   - Chromium grants it silently based on engagement — installing the PWA or
 *     bookmarking it usually flips it, and there is nothing useful to tell the user
 *     beyond that.
 *   - Firefox prompts, so a refusal is a decision the user made and may want to revisit.
 *   - Safari does not implement it at all, so the honest answer is "we asked and cannot
 *     find out", not "granted".
 *
 * The point of a refusal is never to block anything. It is to make the one mitigation
 * that always works — export a copy — visible *before* the data is gone rather than
 * after.
