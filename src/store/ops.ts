/**
 * The operation envelope: what a single mutation looks like on disk and on the wire.
 *
 * State in Astraya is a fold over an append-only log, which makes one property
 * load-bearing in a way it never is for a server-side schema: **an operation written
 * today must stay interpretable by every future version of the app.** There is no
 * migration window. A device that has been in a drawer for two years syncs, and its
 * two-year-old operations must still mean what they meant — while operations written
 * by a *newer* client, already synced to that device, must survive being handled by
 * the older code that cannot read them.
 *
 * Two rules follow, and they are the whole design:
 *
 * 1. **The spine is frozen forever; only the body is versioned.** `opVersion`, `hlc`
 *    and `deviceId` can never change shape, because an old client must be able to
 *    order and forward an operation whose body it cannot interpret. Everything that
 *    might need to change lives in the body, behind the version number.
 *
 * 2. **Shape is validated here, meaning is validated by the fold.** `entity` and
 *    `field` are an open vocabulary: a newer client adding a new kind of record does
 *    not change the operation *shape*, so it need not bump `opVersion`. If this
 *    module checked entity names against a closed list, every new entity would force
 *    a version bump, and — far worse — an older client would classify a perfectly
 *    well-formed operation as corrupt. So the fold (#95) ignores entities it does not
 *    know while the log keeps them.
 *
 * Nothing is ever dropped. An operation this version cannot use is classified, not
 * discarded: the log stores records exactly as received, and this module only reads
 * them. That is why `decode` returns a verdict instead of throwing — a corrupt record
 * must be reportable and retainable, not fatal to a whole sync.
 *
 * Tombstones and undo (#96) are a later concern: they are a `field` convention on top
 * of this envelope, not a change to it.
 */

/**
 * @module store/ops
 * @purpose Defines the operation envelope — the exact shape of a single mutation on disk and on the wire — and the decode/encode logic that keeps old and new clients mutually interpretable forever.
 * @conventions The spine (`opVersion`, `hlc`, `deviceId`) is frozen forever and can never change shape, since an old client must still be able to order and forward an operation whose body it cannot read; only the body is versioned, with an `UPCASTS` chain upgrading older bodies to the current version; `entity`/`field` form an open vocabulary validated structurally rather than against a closed list, so a newer client's new entity kind does not require a version bump; `decode` always returns a verdict (`known`/`future`/`corrupt`) rather than throwing, since one bad record must not fail a whole sync; `newRecord` is the opposite and throws, since a bad value there is this build's own bug.
