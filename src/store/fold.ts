/**
 * Fold the operation log into people and charts.
 *
 * This is where a list of mutations becomes something a screen can show. It is a pure
 * function of the records, with no IndexedDB and no clock, because it is the piece whose
 * determinism everything else depends on: two devices holding the same records must
 * materialise byte-identical state, or sync is a slow corruption rather than a feature.
 *
 * **Last write wins, per field, by timestamp.** Because timestamps are totally ordered
 * and include the writing device, there are no ties to break and the winner does not
 * depend on arrival order. Full CRDT machinery is deliberately not used: Actual Budget
 * needs it because budgets take concurrent numeric edits to shared cells, whereas here
 * one person creates a record once and rarely edits it. A per-field register keyed by
 * HLC converges just as deterministically and is a fraction of the code. That is a
 * considered simplification, not an unfinished one — do not "upgrade" it without a case
 * that actually needs it.
 *
 * **Deleting is a field, not a removal.** A device that was offline during a delete
 * would resurrect the record on its next sync if deleting meant dropping rows. So a
 * delete sets `deleted` to true and the fold hides it, which makes undo just another
 * operation, and makes an edit racing a delete resolve the way a reader would expect:
 * editing a name is not an undelete, because it writes a different register (#96).
 *
 * **Registers are the snapshot.** Startup must not be O(all history), so the register
 * map is serialisable and can be persisted and resumed from. The log stays the source of
 * truth and a snapshot is only a cache — `applyRecords` on a fresh register map rebuilds
 * it exactly, which is the recovery path when a snapshot is ever wrong, and is tested as
 * such rather than assumed.

/**
 * @module store/fold
 * @purpose Folds the append-only operation log into materialised people and charts — the pure, deterministic function every rendered screen's state depends on.
 * @conventions Last-write-wins per field by HLC timestamp, deliberately not a full CRDT, since one person typically creates a record once and rarely edits it concurrently; deleting sets a `deleted` field rather than removing the record, so undo is just another write; a `purged` field (once set, never unset) hides an entity entirely regardless of any other field's timestamp; registers are serialisable so they can be persisted as a snapshot and `resume`d from, with a full rebuild as the correctness fallback whenever a snapshot cannot be trusted.
