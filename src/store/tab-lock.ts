 * One exclusive writer tab per store (#311).

 * from minting an HLC at the same moment, and nothing merges the two clocks —
 * so two tabs writing "concurrently" can produce colliding HLCs, silently
 * overwriting each other's operations. Rather than attempt to merge two
 * independent clocks, exactly one tab is allowed to write; every other tab
 * is read-only until the writer tab closes (or itself gives up the lock).

 * @conventions Requests an exclusive lock with `ifAvailable: true` so a non-writer tab learns immediately that it is read-only instead of queueing; falls back to always-writable when `navigator.locks` is unavailable (older browsers, test environments), since that is today's existing behaviour rather than a new risk.
