/**
 * IndexedDB: where the log actually lives.
 *
 * For a user who never signs in, this is the *only* copy of their data — not a cache of
 * something a server holds. That single fact drives everything here: schema changes must
 * never discard a record, writes must be durable before the UI claims success, and a
 * browser evicting the origin's storage is data loss rather than a slow reload (#98).
 *
 * The store is deliberately dumb. It holds records keyed by timestamp and knows nothing
 * about people, charts or fields — the fold owns all of that. So a new domain field ships
 * as a client release with no database migration at all, which is the same property that
 * lets the server stay a relay.
 *
 * Snapshots live in their own store and are only ever a cache. If a snapshot is missing,
 * stale or wrong, `resume` rebuilds from the log; nothing here is allowed to treat a
 * snapshot as authoritative.
 *
 * SQLite-WASM was considered and rejected: we already ship 2.5 MB of WebAssembly for the
 * ephemeris, and a few thousand records do not need a query planner.
