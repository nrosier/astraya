 * Module: types/tz-lookup

 * Conventions: n/a (ambient declaration only, no runtime code).
 * Exports: default export of the `tz-lookup` module (declared ambiently, not re-exported from here).
 *
 * `tz-lookup` ships no type declarations. It is a single CC0 function mapping a
 * coordinate to an IANA zone name using a compiled polygon table.
