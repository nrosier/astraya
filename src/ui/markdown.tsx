/**
 * A deliberately small Markdown renderer for the changelog.
 *
 * Astraya ships its own `CHANGELOG.md` and renders it in-app, so clicking the
 * version shows what changed without leaving for GitHub. That needs Markdown, but
 * not much of it: headings, lists, paragraphs, bold, code and links.
 *
 * It renders to React elements and **never** touches `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. The
 * changelog is our own committed file rather than user input, so injection is not
 * the live threat — but a renderer that cannot produce raw HTML cannot be turned
 * into an injection sink later either, and that is worth more than the few lines a
 * library would have saved. It also keeps the bundle free of a dependency whose
 * whole job is turning text into markup.
 *
 * Anything it does not understand is rendered as plain text rather than dropped.
 * Silently swallowing a changelog entry would be worse than showing its syntax.
