/**
 * The app's UI locale (#158) — originally added as a `ReportView`-only picker, then promoted
 * to sit next to `ThemeToggle` as an app-wide setting. It now drives every UI message
 * catalogue (`useMessages`, in `messages.ts`) as well as the interpretation report's language.
 * The storage key still says `reportLocale`: renaming it would reset every existing user's
 * choice for no benefit, since the value it holds hasn't changed — only its scope has.
 *
 * A plain module-level store rather than React context: `LanguageToggle` (mounted once,
 * globally) and `ReportView` (mounted only while that tab is open) both need to read and
 * react to the same value with no provider wiring `App.tsx` would otherwise need. Same
 * `useSyncExternalStore` shape `SyncBadge.tsx` uses for sync status, including its
 * `OFF_STATUS`-style stable snapshot: returning a fresh value from `getSnapshot` would
 * make React re-render forever.
