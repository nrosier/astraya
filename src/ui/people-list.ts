 * @module ui/people-list

 * @conventions Kept out of the component so it is directly testable; deliberately never overstates a record's completeness (never shows a chart as castable when coordinates are missing); uses people-list.messages.ts via direct catalogue lookup for its i18n text.
 * @exports ordered, caveated, summary
