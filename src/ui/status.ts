/**
 * What the status line says, and why (#101).
 *
 * One rule decides everything here: the user must always be able to tell whether their data
 * exists anywhere but this device. The failure this guards against is not a missing badge —
 * it is a reassuring one. A sync that has been failing since breakfast must not look like a
 * sync that succeeded a minute ago, and a device holding the only copy of a birth record
 * must say so rather than show a tick.
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does *not* say:
 *
 * - "Offline" to a user who is not signed in. For them offline is the normal mode, not a
 *   degraded one — everything works, nothing is pending, and there is no server to be
 *   disconnected from. Announcing it would invent a problem.
 * - "Synced" while any local change is unacknowledged. A tick that means "some of your
 *   data reached the server" is worse than no tick.
 *
 * Sync itself arrives in M8. Its states are modelled now so the indicator does not have to
 * be redesigned around them later; until then the store reports `off`.
 */
/**
 * @module ui/status
 * @purpose Decides what the sync-status indicator says and why (#101): computes a Status (tone/label/detail/action) from sync/persistence/pending/quarantine state, so the user can always tell whether their data exists anywhere but this device.
 * @conventions Pure functions taking an explicit `t` of status.messages.ts's shape rather than reading locale themselves; deliberately avoids showing "Offline" to a signed-out user and avoids "Synced" while any local change is unacknowledged; a failing sync escalates tone only after staying stale past LOUD_AFTER_MS, to avoid training users to ignore transient blips.
