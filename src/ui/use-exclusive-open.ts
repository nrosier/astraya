/**
 * The open/close rules of a row of dropdown buttons (#417), as one hook so they hold for every
 * menu that adopts them and can be tested without mounting the page around them.
 *
 * What a dropdown is expected to do, and a native `<details>` does not:
 * - **One at a time:** opening a group closes whichever was open.
 * - **Choosing something closes it** — the caller closes on selection via `close`.
 * - **Clicking or tapping anywhere outside** the open group closes it, including on another
 *   group's button (which then opens that one) and on the current page's own link.
 * - **Escape closes it** and puts focus back on the button that opened it, so a keyboard user is
 *   not left on an element that has just disappeared.
 * - **Tabbing out of it closes it.**
 * - **Changing page closes it** (`resetKey`), so a navigation never leaves a stale menu behind.
 *
 * The caller owns the markup: it registers each group's wrapper element with `groupRef(key)` (a
 * button and its popup must both be inside it, so pressing on the popup is "inside") and each
 * button with `buttonRef(key)`.
 */
