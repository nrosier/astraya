/**
 * Thin `fetch()` wrapper for `POST /api/interpretation/generate`
 * (`server/interpretation-routes.ts`), the one runtime path in Astraya that
 * calls a third-party model provider — proxied entirely through the server,
 * per ADR 0003. Same shape as `admin-client.ts`: nothing here interprets a
 * response beyond its own shape, and every rejection carries the server's
 * own message.
 *
 * Three modes, see ADR 0003:
 * - `'grounded'` sends `placementKeys` (from `report.ts`'s
 *   `reportPlacementKeys`) rather than the chart or corpus text itself — the
 *   server re-resolves each key's grounded Tier-1 text against its own copy
 *   of the corpus, so no interpretation prose crosses the wire from the
 *   client at all, only the de-identified placement keys already safe to
 *   send per ADR 0003's structural PII-minimization, and the model only
 *   restyles that given text.
 * - `'freeform'` sends `chartData` (computed positions/houses/aspects — see
 *   `toTier2ChartPayload`) and lets the model originate its own
 *   interpretation from it, reasoning across the whole chart's placements
 *   together. This deliberately gives up grounded mode's "no chart data crosses
 *   the wire" guarantee for this mode only; ADR 0003 documents the tradeoff.
 *   The instruction is optional (#425; this mode also replaces the former
 *   `'synthesis'` mode, which was the same call with no instruction).
 *
 * - `'focus'` (#424) sends `focusContext`: the sign, house, dispositor, rulerships and aspects of ONE
 *   selected placement (see `focus-context.ts`), and asks the model for that placement's tensions.
 *   There is no instruction, so nothing for the verifier to judge.
 *
 * `locale` is sent alongside either payload so the server responds in the
 * language the report is already showing.
