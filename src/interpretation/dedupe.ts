/**
 * Corpus dedupe pass (#58): at the corpus's eventual full size — around 1200
 * entries once #56 has generated the long tail on top of #55's exemplars — the
 * failure mode a reader actually hits is not a wrong fact but prose that all
 * sounds the same. Two placements can be substantively different and still
 * read as copy-pasted if a generator (or a tired human) reused the same
 * sentence shape.
 *
 * Similarity is character-trigram Jaccard, not an embedding: it needs no
 * network call and no model, which keeps this pass usable from `src/` — see
 * `test/no-runtime-llm-access.test.ts` (#64) — and deterministic enough to
 * gate CI on. It is also a different signal from #57's `repetitive-openings`
 * rule: that catches entries that only *start* alike; this catches entries
 * that are substantially the same text throughout, wherever in the corpus
 * they fall.
 *
 * Comparison is scoped to entries in the same locale — an `en` entry and its
 * `nl` translation are supposed to say the same thing, so cross-locale
 * similarity would just flag every correctly-translated pair.

Comparison is scoped per-locale. Distinct from lint.ts's `repetitive-openings` rule, which only catches shared openings, not whole-text similarity.
