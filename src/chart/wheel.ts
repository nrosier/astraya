/**
 * The wheel coordinate system every chart layer shares (#39).
 *
 * `wheelAngle` and `pointOnCircle` are the whole contract: a longitude becomes
 * a screen angle, and an angle plus a radius becomes a point. Rings, ticks,
 * cusps, body glyphs (#40/#41), aspect chords (#42), overlays (#148) and the
 * 90-degree dial all draw through these two functions rather than each
 * deriving its own trigonometry, which is what keeps the layers aligned when
 * the orientation options below change.
 *
 * Radii used to be derived per-file here as `size * 0.08`-style fractions;
 * they now live in `sheet-geometry.ts`, one named layout for the whole sheet.
 * This module is deliberately geometry-only and draws nothing.
 *
 * Orientation and sweep direction (#43) default to the near-universal
 * convention: the Ascendant at the 9 o'clock position, houses running
 * counterclockwise from there (so the Midheaven, wherever it actually falls
 * for the input houses, reads roughly upward rather than at a forced 12
 * o'clock — real geometry, not an idealised quadrant chart).

/**
 * @module chart/wheel
 * @purpose Defines the shared wheel coordinate system (`wheelAngle`, `pointOnCircle`) and the orientation/sweep/wedge-style types every chart layer in `src/chart/` draws through, so rings, ticks, cusps, glyphs, aspect chords and overlays stay aligned.
 * @conventions Pure geometry only — draws nothing itself. Default convention: Ascendant fixed at 9 o'clock (`asc-left`, screen angle 180), longitude increasing counterclockwise (near-universal chart-wheel convention); `orientation: 'aries-up'` instead fixes 0° Aries at 12 o'clock (screen angle 90) so the wheel doesn't rotate with birth time; `sweep: 'clockwise'` reverses direction. All layers drawing into the same wheel must pass identical orientation options or drift out of alignment. Radii themselves now live in `sheet-geometry.ts`.
