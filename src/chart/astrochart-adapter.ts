 * Adapts a computed chart to the input shape `@astrodraw/astrochart`'s `radix()`

 * file that knows about that library's data format; nothing else in `src/chart/*`
 * or the export pipeline depends on it.
 *
 * AstroChart recognizes a fixed, small set of point names — anything else falls
 * through to its default glyph, an unlabelled circle, which is worse than leaving
 * the point out. `BODY_KEY_TO_ASTROCHART_NAME` is therefore a deliberate subset:
 * the ten classical bodies and Chiron map straight across (Astraya's own
 * `BodyDefinition.name` already matches AstroChart's naming), and of Astraya's two
 * lunar nodes and three Liliths — models AstroChart has only one glyph slot each
 * for — the more commonly displayed variant of each (the true node, the mean
 * "Black Moon" Lilith) is chosen. The four asteroids have no slot at all and are
 * omitted.
