/**
 * A small standalone diagram for the chart's Jones shape (#401) — a visual complement to #398's
 * plain-text "Chart Shape: Bucket" sentence, not a replacement for it.
 *
 * Deliberately decoupled from the real wheel (`multi-wheel.ts`): this draws the *abstract*
 * pattern `jonesShapeOf` found — which arcs are occupied, which are empty, where the groups and
 * (for a Bucket) the handle sit — using this person's actual body longitudes, but with none of
 * the real wheel's houses/signs/aspects/other chrome. That keeps it simple enough to generate
 * independently, the same way `degree-strip.ts`/`emphasis-grid.ts` are their own small renderers
 * fed a narrow slice of `ChartData` rather than panels bolted onto `multi-wheel.ts`.
 *
 * All seven shapes render through one mechanism, with no per-shape special case beyond the
 * handle highlight: `JonesShapeResult.groups` is already exactly "one wedge per occupied arc" —
 * bundle/bowl/locomotive/splash are the one-group case (a single wedge whose width is `span`),
 * seesaw/bucket are the two-group case, splay is three or more. A one-body group (a Bucket's
 * handle, or in principle any isolated single body) draws as a dot with no wedge, since a wedge
 * from a point to itself has no width to show.

/**
 * @module chart/jones-shape-diagram
 * @purpose Renders a small standalone abstract diagram of the chart's Jones shape (bundle/bowl/locomotive/splash/seesaw/bucket/splay), as a visual complement to the plain-text shape description.
 * @conventions Deliberately decoupled from the real wheel — no houses/signs/aspects/chrome — fixed at `{ orientation: 'aries-up' }` with no Ascendant anchor of its own; every shape renders through one mechanism since `JonesShapeResult.groups` is already "one wedge per occupied arc" (one group = bundle/bowl/locomotive/splash, two groups = seesaw/bucket, three-or-more = splay), with a one-body group drawn as a bare dot (a wedge needs width) and the handle (if any) highlighted.
