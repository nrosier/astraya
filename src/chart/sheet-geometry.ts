/**
 * One scale knob for every radius, tick, glyph and font in a chart sheet.
 *
 * The layout (#412) follows the classic Astrodienst/Astro-Seek wheel, outside in:
 *
 *   1. the zodiac dial (`zodiacOuter`-`zodiacInner`): the twelve sign glyphs, with sign
 *      boundaries spanning the band;
 *   2. the degree ruler: 1°/5°/10° ticks hanging inward from `zodiacInner`, with no circle
 *      of their own;
 *   3. the planet band (`houseRing`-`planetRingOuter`), the widest ring: each body drawn as a
 *      radial stack of glyph, degree, sign and minutes along its own spoke;
 *   4. the house dial (`aspectCircle`-`houseRing`): a narrow ring holding the house numbers
 *      and the ASC/DSC/MC/IC labels, with a tick at each body's true degree on its outer edge;
 *   5. the aspect disk (r <= `aspectCircle`), where the chords are drawn.
 *
 * Every value is quoted in pixels on an 800x800 canvas and multiplied by `size / 800`, so
 * `resolveSheetGeometry(800)` reproduces those figures exactly and any other size scales
 * proportionally — the sheet has to stay legible as a 2400px PNG or in print.
 *
 * Radii are named fields rather than an array because each is a different *kind* of
 * boundary (a ring edge, a glyph track, a chord limit), and callers reference them by
 * meaning.

/**
 * @module chart/sheet-geometry
 * @purpose The single scale/layout authority for every radius, tick, glyph and font size in a chart sheet, following the classic Astrodienst/Astro-Seek wheel layout outside-in (zodiac dial, degree ruler, planet band, house dial, aspect disk).
 * @conventions All reference figures are quoted in pixels on an 800x800 canvas (`REFERENCE_SIZE`) and linearly scaled by `size / 800`, so `resolveSheetGeometry(800)` reproduces the literal reference numbers exactly; radii are named fields (not an array) since each is a semantically distinct boundary; `resolveRingBands` splits the shared planet band into one sub-band per wheel ring, with a single ring getting the full reference radial glyph/degree/sign/minute stack and multiple rings each just centring their glyphs.
 * @exports resolveSheetGeometry, resolveRingBands, TICK_INTERVAL_DEG, TICK_MEDIUM_INTERVAL_DEG, TICK_MAJOR_INTERVAL_DEG; SheetGeometry, PanelLayout, PanelRender, RingBand types.
