 * 1. **A coordinate lookup can be off by a whole hour.** `tz-lookup` resolves
 *    Vevay, Indiana to `America/New_York` rather than `America/Indiana/Vevay`.
 *    Those share today's rules but not 1960's, so a 1960 birth there comes out an
 *    hour wrong — about 15 degrees of Ascendant. Rather than special-casing
 *    Indiana, `offsetDisagreesNearby` samples a ring around the coordinate and
 *    reports when neighbours disagree *at the birth instant*. That catches
 *    Indiana, the Basel tri-border, and open water alike.
 *
 * 2. **tzdb's pre-standard-time offsets belong to the zone's reference city**,
 *    not to the birthplace, so longitude-derived LMT is better — but only where
 *    tzdb genuinely has no standard time. New Zealand adopted standard time in
 *    1868 and Liberia kept a legal -0:44:30 until 1972; overriding either with
 *    longitude would make them worse. See `useLocalMeanTime`.
