/**
 * Resolve a stated birth moment to a UTC offset, with its provenance.

 * *and* keeps the alternatives. The user is the only one who can settle those, so
 * hiding them behind a single confident number is the failure mode to avoid.
 *
 * Turning the offset into a Julian day is the ephemeris boundary's job, so that
 * delta-T, leap seconds and the calendar flag stay with Swiss Ephemeris rather
 * than being reimplemented here. See `src/time/julian.ts`.
