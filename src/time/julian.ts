/**
 * From a resolved birth moment to a Julian day (UT) — the ephemeris's only input.
 *
 * Two paths, chosen by date, because the accurate one does not exist for most of
 * history:
 *
 * - **1972 onward** the local time is converted to UTC civil fields and handed to
 *   `swe_utc_to_jd`, which knows about leap seconds. UT1 differs from UTC by up to
 *   0.9 s, which is about 13 arcseconds of Ascendant — inside our 1 arcminute cusp
 *   tolerance, but free to get right, so we get it right.
 * - **Before that**, and for any Julian-calendar date, the offset is applied in
 *   Julian-day space: `swe_julday` at midnight plus the elapsed fraction of a day.
 *   UTC did not exist, so there are no leap seconds to be aware of, and staying in
 *   JD space means no date arithmetic of ours has to know that an offset can push a
 *   birth across midnight, a month end, a year end, or the Gregorian reform gap.
