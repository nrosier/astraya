/**
 * A person: the primary entity, and the owner of birth data.
 *
 * Everything the app computes comes from one of these. A chart is derived, so a person
 * is the only thing that has to be stored correctly.
 *
 * Two decisions here are worth reading before changing anything.
 *
 * **The stored record is the input, not the resolution.** A person holds what someone
 * typed — civil time, coordinates, an optional stated offset — and *not* a resolved
 * UTC offset as its source of truth. Historical offsets are data, and the data changes:
 * this project has measured two tzdb versions disagreeing about the same 1960 instant.
 * If the resolution were the stored truth, a chart could never be recomputed; if it
 * were absent, a tzdb update would move someone's Ascendant with no warning. So the
 * resolution is stored *as a witness* — the offset, the zone, and the tzdb version that
 * produced it — which is enough to notice the disagreement and say so (#20).
 *
 * **A field this build cannot read is absent, never defaulted.** Coordinates in
 * particular: `{0, 0}` is a real place in the Gulf of Guinea, and a chart cast there
 * looks entirely plausible. So a person whose birth moment did not survive validation
 * has no moment at all and lists what is missing, rather than being quietly charted
 * somewhere nobody was born.

/**
 * @module person
 * @purpose Defines the `Person` entity — the primary entity and owner of birth data that every computed chart derives from — and assembles it from op-log register values.
 * @conventions Stores the civil-time/coordinates input as typed, never a resolved UTC offset, since historical timezone data can change (an `OffsetWitness` records what a past resolution said, for detecting drift, not for reuse); a field this build cannot read is reported as absent via `missing`, never defaulted (e.g. `{0,0}` is a real place, so it is never substituted for missing coordinates); `TimeAccuracy` distinguishes a genuinely unknown birth time, for which houses/angles are meaningless rather than merely approximate.
