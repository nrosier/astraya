/**
 * Computes everything a chart's data tables need from a birth moment (#44).
 *
 * Deliberately decoupled from the `Chart` entity in `chart.ts`: that entity
 * holds no computed positions by design (see its own doc comment), and no UI
 * yet exists to create or persist one. This module instead takes a birth
 * moment directly, the same input `PersonForm`/`person-form.ts` already
 * produce, so a future chart-settings UI can supply real `ChartCalculationOptions`
 * later without this module changing shape.
 *
 * Everything here is one pass over the ephemeris: a single Julian day, one
 * batch position call, one house call, then pure arithmetic over the results
 * for aspects, dignities, sect and the two derived points. Nothing is cached
 * or stored — recomputing is cheap, and storing results would only create a
 * second version of the truth the `Chart` doc comment already warns against.
