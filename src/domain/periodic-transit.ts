/**
 * Periodic transit forecast (#207): daily, weekly, monthly and yearly tiers
 * of "what's happening in the sky against this natal chart right now",
 * following the same natal/transiting split `computeTransit` already models
 * (`fixedSubjects` for the natal side, `subjectsFrom`/real speed for the
 * transiting side) rather than inventing a new convention.
 *
 * Each tier answers a different question, at a different grain, so each
 * needs different machinery:
 *
 * - **Daily** — the transiting Moon's current sign/house against the natal
 *   chart and its in-orb (not necessarily exact) aspects, since a whole-day
 *   grain is exactly what the Moon (~13°/day) is fast enough to make
 *   meaningful; plus any exact aspect (Moon included) and any fast-planet
 *   station landing within that specific day.
 * - **Weekly/monthly** — exact aspects only (`findExactTransitAspects`,
 *   `astrology/transit-events.ts`), for the Sun and the eight `'planet'`-
 *   category bodies. The Moon is deliberately excluded here: at ~13°/day it
 *   would produce several exact aspects to most of the natal chart every
 *   single week, which is not what "what's exact this week" is asking for —
 *   that's the daily tier's job. Monthly additionally reports the transiting
 *   Sun's natal house/sign for the month, since the Sun's position changes
 *   little enough within a month that a single house/sign is a meaningful
 *   summary the way it isn't for any faster body.
 * - **Yearly** — ties into `computeSolarReturn` directly rather than
 *   reinventing an annual forecast, per this issue's own scope note. This is
 *   also the resolution `report.ts`'s file doc promised for M7 #61's
 *   deferred "current timing from progressions and the year's solar return"
 *   item: superseded, not carried forward — the progressions half of that
 *   note is computed (`domain/secondary-progression.ts`) but, per #398's
 *   audit, has no dedicated screen yet (`SecondaryProgressionView.tsx` does
 *   not exist). Forcing a solar return's cross-chart contacts into
 *   `ChartData`'s shape (which `report.ts` correctly declined to do, since a
 *   return has no `dignities`/`sect` of its own) is exactly what this
 *   separate forecast pipeline exists to avoid needing, independent of when
 *   a progressions screen gets built.
 *
 * No text lives here. Like `computeChartData`/`computeTransit`, this module
 * produces structured events keyed by `BodyId`; turning an event into a
 * sentence is `interpretation/compose.ts`'s job (via the `transit-aspect`
 * `CorpusPlacement` category, #207's schema addition) and is left to the UI
 * layer that has a locale to ask for, the same separation
 * `ReportView.tsx` already keeps from `report.ts`.

/**
 * @module periodic-transit
 * @purpose Builds the daily/weekly/monthly/yearly periodic transit forecast against a natal chart (#207) — "what's happening in the sky right now" at four different grains.
 * @conventions Follows the natal/transiting split `computeTransit` models (`fixedSubjects` for natal, real speed for transiting); daily uses in-orb Moon aspects plus exact-today events/stations, weekly/monthly use exact-aspect search excluding the Moon (too fast to be meaningful at that grain), yearly delegates to `computeSolarReturn`/`computeDemibirthday`; produces structured events only — turning an event into a sentence is `interpretation/compose.ts`'s job.
