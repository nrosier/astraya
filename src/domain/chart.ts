/**
 * A chart: a view of a person, plus the settings that reproduce it.
 *
 * Charts hold no computed positions. Everything a wheel shows is recalculated from the
 * person's birth moment and these settings in a few milliseconds, so storing results
 * would only create a second version of the truth that could fall out of step with the
 * ephemeris. What is stored is exactly what is needed to get the same answer again.
 *
 * **Settings are kept verbatim, and unknown ones are kept too.** A chart made by a
 * newer build may name a house system this build has never heard of. Substituting a
 * default would silently show a different chart under the same name, so an unknown
 * setting is surfaced as unsupported instead — and, because the value is retained
 * untouched, the chart still renders correctly on the build that understands it.
 *
 * **Each setting is its own register**, written as a dotted field name
 * (`settings.houseSystem`). This is the opposite granularity from a person's birth
 * moment, on purpose: for coordinates a merged half-and-half value would be a place
 * nobody was born, so the moment is written whole; for settings a merge is harmless
 * and losing an unrelated change would just be annoying.
