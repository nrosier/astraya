/**
 * A whole chart — birth data plus the settings that reproduce it — as a URL.
 *
 * #65: sharing a chart must not involve our server at all, so the link has to carry
 * everything: the recipient's browser recomputes the chart from these parameters alone,
 * the same way `time/encode.ts` already lets a birth moment round-trip through a link.
 * This module wraps that encoding and adds the one thing a bare moment link doesn't need:
 * chart settings (house system, zodiac, wheel display, …), plus a version tag so a link
 * minted by an older or newer build still decodes under the rules it was written for.
 *
 * Settings are carried as opaque JSON, not as individually-named parameters. `Chart`
 * (`domain/chart.ts`) already treats settings as a verbatim bag whose keys are owned by
 * whichever module consumes them — duplicating that list of keys here would drift from it
 * the moment a new setting is added elsewhere. A share link keeps the same guarantee: a
 * setting this build has never heard of still round-trips untouched.
