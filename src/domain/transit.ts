/**
 * Computes a transit bi-wheel for one saved person against a chosen moment (#172).
 *
 * "Transit" here means the everyday sense astrologers use it in: the sky right now (or at
 * any other chosen moment), read against a natal chart that stays fixed. That asymmetry is
 * exactly what `fixedSubjects`/`subjectsFrom` (`astrology/aspects.ts`) already model for the
 * M6 progression/return/direction modules — the transiting side is genuinely moving at the
 * target moment, so it uses its own real speed (`subjectsFrom`), while the natal side is a
 * reference being checked against, not itself in motion right now (`fixedSubjects`). This
 * mirrors `secondary-progression.ts`'s `contacts` convention exactly, just with "transiting"
 * standing in for "progressed".
 *
 * The transiting ring is cast for the natal place, not an arbitrary second location — the
 * issue this implements only asks for "current (or arbitrary) time", not a second place, and
 * that also matches how most astrology software casts a transit chart (transiting planets in
 * the houses of *this* birthplace, or of wherever the reading is being done from — Astraya has
 * no other place on record for a saved person than their birth coordinates).
 *
 * Both rings are full `ChartData` (not just positions), so any existing table, wheel or sheet
 * helper built for a single chart's `ChartData` works unchanged for either ring here.
