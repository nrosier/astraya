 * change when it later syncs, because operations already reference it. So the id has
 * to be unique across devices that have never spoken to each other — which rules out
 * a counter and makes randomness the only option.
 *
 * 80 bits from the CSPRNG. Two devices would need on the order of 10^12 records before
 * a collision became likely, which is not a number this application will reach, and
 * the alternative — coordinating id assignment — would need a network.
 *
 * These are not secrets and must not be treated as unguessable capabilities: the
 * server authorises by user, not by id (#80).
