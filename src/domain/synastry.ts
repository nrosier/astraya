/**
 * Computes a synastry bi-wheel comparing two people's natal charts (#172).
 *
 * Synastry is not a fixed-reference-versus-moving comparison the way a transit, progression
 * or return is: both charts are equally "real" natal moments, neither one a reference frame
 * the other moves against. `astrology/aspects.ts`'s `fixedSubjects` exists precisely to zero
 * out a side's own speed so it doesn't leak into the applying/separating calculation for a
 * side that is genuinely moving *right now* — that reasoning has no side to attach to here,
 * since neither person's chart is "now" relative to the other. Both sides therefore use
 * `subjectsFrom` (each chart's own real, natal speed), unlike every M6 cross-chart caller and
 * unlike this same issue's `transit.ts`, which does have that asymmetry and uses
 * `fixedSubjects` for its natal side accordingly.
 *
 * Both charts are full `ChartData`, computed independently — nothing here assumes the two
 * people share a place or time, and nothing about one chart's own dignities, sect or angles
 * depends on the other's.
