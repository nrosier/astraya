/**
 * The Moon's phase at a moment (#403): its elongation from the Sun, the modern eight-fold
 * name for it, and how much of the disk is lit.
 *
 * Convention, stated rather than picked silently: the eight phases are Dane Rudhyar's lunation
 * cycle, as Astro-Seek shows it, split into equal 45° slices of elongation counted from the
 * New Moon conjunction — New 0-45, Crescent 45-90, First Quarter 90-135, Gibbous 135-180, Full
 * 180-225, Disseminating 225-270, Last Quarter 270-315, Balsamic 315-360. A phase begins at its
 * lower bound, so an elongation of exactly 90° is the First Quarter and exactly 180° the Full Moon.
 * (Some traditions centre the New/Full/Quarter phases on their exact angle instead; this follows
 * the plain sliced-from-conjunction reading Astro-Seek prints.)
 *
 * Elongation is the Moon's longitude minus the Sun's, in [0, 360): increasing through the
 * waxing half and past 180° through the waning half, so it alone says waxing from waning, which
 * an unsigned angular separation could not. It is ecliptic longitude only, not the true
 * phase angle, which also depends on the Moon's latitude and distance — the difference is
 * under a degree, far below what a name or a rounded percentage can show.
