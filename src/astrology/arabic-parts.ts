/**
 * Sect-correct Part of Fortune, Part of Spirit, and the general Arabic/Hermetic
 * lot formula they're both built from (#29).
 *
 * Every classical part reduces to `base + a - b`, wrapped to a longitude.
 * Fortune and Spirit are the two whose `a`/`b` swap between day and night
 * charts — get the sect backwards and the swap goes the wrong way, silently
 * producing the other part's position instead. `sectReversingPart` makes
 * that swap the one place the direction can be gotten wrong, rather than
 * repeating the day/night branch at every call site.
 *
 * Only Fortune and Spirit are implemented here: unlike those two, most of
 * the wider catalogue of Arabic parts (marriage, death, and the rest) has
 * genuinely disputed formulas across sources, and this project would rather
 * leave a part out than guess at an unverified one — the same call made for
 * the Egyptian/Ptolemaic bounds (see #26). `arabicPart` is exported so
 * further parts can be added later once a formula is actually confirmed.
