/**
 * Secondary progressions: day-for-year, with a selectable method for progressing
 * the MC and the houses that follow from it (#46).
 *
 * Bodies progress by direct day-for-year substitution: their positions are simply
 * the ordinary ephemeris positions at the progressed Julian day, no different from
 * a natal calculation at a later date. The angles are not that simple, because
 * "the sky's rotation for one day" is itself what the three schools of secondary
 * progression disagree about:
 *
 * - `'quotidian'` recomputes the houses outright at the progressed moment, using
 *   the natal clock time and place. Because the progressed Julian day is only a
 *   few days past the natal one (one day per year of age), the MC this produces
 *   moves by close to the mean solar rate — nearly, but not exactly, what
 *   `'naibod'` below gives by simple arithmetic. Where quotidian visibly departs
 *   from the two symbolic methods is everywhere else: the Ascendant and the other
 *   cusps are a non-linear function of the progressed sidereal time, latitude and
 *   obliquity, not a rigid rotation of the natal ones, so they drift apart from a
 *   naibod/solar-arc chart even while the MCs stay close.
 * - `'naibod'` instead rotates every natal angle and cusp by a symbolic arc: the
 *   mean Sun's daily motion (360 degrees divided by the tropical year, about
 *   59'08") times the number of years of age. A uniform rate, chosen for its
 *   simplicity, in use for over a century.
 * - `'solarArc'` rotates the same way, but by the *true* solar arc — the actual
 *   distance the real Sun travelled between the natal and progressed Julian days
 *   — rather than the Sun's mean rate.
 *
 * Naibod and solar arc rotate the whole natal house wheel rigidly: every cusp and
 * every named angle moves by the same arc the MC does. That rigid rotation is what
 * "houses derived from the progressed MC" means for a symbolic method; quotidian
 * has no such arc because it recomputes the houses directly instead.
