/**
 * Void-of-course Moon (#402): whether the Moon, at a given moment, has made its last exact
 * aspect before leaving its sign — and so is "void" until it enters the next.
 *
 * Convention, stated rather than picked silently (traditions disagree, and a result that changes
 * with the convention should say which one it used):
 *
 * - **Aspects:** the five Ptolemaic aspects — conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition.
 *   Minor aspects do not end a void period. Orbs play no part: an aspect counts at the moment it
 *   is *exact*, which is what "perfects" means; the Moon is not "applying" its way out of the void.
 * - **Bodies:** the Sun and the planets Mercury through Pluto (the default of Astro-Seek's
 *   calculator). A traditional practitioner who counts only the classical seven (through Saturn)
 *   can pass `bodies` for that; the outer planets are included by default because modern
 *   practice does.
 * - **Void period:** from the Moon's last exact aspect inside its current sign (or, if it made
 *   none yet, from the moment it entered the sign) until it enters the next sign. The Moon is
 *   void at a moment exactly when no further aspect perfects before that ingress.
 *
 * The Moon never moves backwards, so it crosses each of these targets at most once per sign, and
 * a sign takes it between roughly two and three days. Within that window the search samples the
 * Moon and every candidate body hourly — the Moon covers about half a degree an hour, so it cannot
 * cross a target and come back between samples — then bisects each sign change down to a second,
 * the same approach `transit-events.ts` uses for a transit to a fixed point, except that here the
 * "target" (another planet) moves too, so the planet is re-queried at every midpoint. Sign
 * entry and exit come from Swiss Ephemeris' own `nextMoonCrossing`.
 */
