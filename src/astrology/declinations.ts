/**
 * Parallels, contraparallels, and out-of-bounds declination (#32).
 *
 * Declination is a body's north/south position off the celestial equator,
 * signed like the ecliptic latitude it replaces once positions are computed
 * with `equatorial: true` — unlike longitude, it does not wrap, so none of
 * this needs the `norm360` every other module in this directory has.
 *
 * A parallel is two bodies at (near enough) the same declination — the
 * equatorial analogue of a conjunction. A contraparallel is two bodies at the
 * same declination magnitude but opposite hemispheres — the analogue of an
 * opposition, since `decA + decB ~= 0` is exactly `decA ~= -decB`.
 *
 * "Out of bounds" is classical shorthand for a body whose declination
 * exceeds the Sun's own maximum — the obliquity of the ecliptic. The Sun,
 * bound to the ecliptic, can never itself go out of bounds; the Moon,
 * planets, and points with ecliptic latitude can.
