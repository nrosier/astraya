/**
 * Annual and monthly profections (#168): a house-per-year rotation of the natal Ascendant,
 * one of the oldest Hellenistic timing techniques and distinct from progressions, solar arc
 * and returns (all M6) — none of those move the Ascendant by whole signs on a fixed schedule.
 *
 * Convention, documented here since sources disagree (the issue's own last checklist item):
 *
 * - Year zero (birth to the first birthday) profects the Ascendant's own sign — the technique
 *   starts counting from the angle itself, not one house past it. Each completed year of age
 *   advances the profection one further sign (mod 12), so ages 12, 24, 36... all land back on
 *   the natal Ascendant's sign, the standard 12-year Hellenistic cycle.
 * - The profected point keeps the Ascendant's own degree within its new sign (e.g. a natal
 *   Ascendant at 14°Leo profects to 14° of whichever sign the year lands on), rather than
 *   sitting at 0° of that sign — this is "whole sign" profection of the *angle*, not a
 *   coarser "which sign is activated" fact with no degree at all.
 * - Monthly profection subdivides the profected year into its own further 12 signs, advancing
 *   one sign per month starting from the year's own profected sign — so by the twelfth month
 *   the rotation has come back around to one sign before the *next* year's profection. Age is
 *   given as a single fractional-years number (`ageInYears` from `progressions.ts`, the same
 *   365.2425-day tropical year every other timing technique in this codebase already uses);
 *   the integer part selects the year, the fractional part split into twelfths selects the
 *   month within it.
 *
 * "Lord of the Year"/"Lord of the Month" is the ruler of the profected sign — callers resolve
 * that themselves via `rulerOf` (`dignities.ts`), since which rulership scheme to use is a
 * caller-level choice this module has no opinion on.
