/**
 * Birth-time rectification (#408): narrowing an uncertain birth time by testing candidate times
 * against the dates of known life events.
 *
 * The idea is the one every rectification starts from: the Ascendant and Midheaven move through
 * the whole zodiac in a day, so they are the points that change with the birth time — a planet's
 * position hardly does. If an event in someone's life lines up with a technique's contact to an
 * angle, the angle was probably about where that candidate time puts it. This module counts those
 * alignments for each candidate and ranks the candidates by the count.
 *
 * **It narrows; it does not prove.** A rectified time is a better-supported guess, never a
 * measurement: the score is a sum of coincidences, some of which are chance, so each result also
 * carries its `lift` over the average candidate — a time that scores only like the average has
 * explained nothing. The screen says so too.
 *
 * Sources disagree on which techniques count as evidence and how to weight them, so the convention
 * used is stated rather than hidden:
 *
 * - **Solar-arc directions** (weight 2, the technique most rectifiers trust for timing): the
 *   secondary-progressed Sun's arc since birth, applied to a point, carries it forward about a
 *   degree a year. A contact counts when a directed angle (Ascendant or Midheaven) falls on a
 *   natal planet, or a directed planet on a natal angle, by conjunction, square or opposition
 *   (`SOLAR_ARC_ORB_DEG`, a degree: roughly a year either side of exact).
 * - **Transits to the angles** (weight 1): Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune or Pluto — the slow
 *   planets, whose contact lasts long enough to line up with a dated event — conjunct, square or
 *   opposite the natal Ascendant or Midheaven within `TRANSIT_ORB_DEG`.
 * - A contact scores its technique's weight scaled by how close it is: full at exact, nothing at the
 *   orb. Every event counts equally; the user chooses which events to supply.
 *
 * Planets are taken at the candidate's own birth moment, so the Moon — which moves a degree every
 * two hours — also helps tell candidates apart, in the directed and natal roles alike.

/**
 * @module Rectification

 * @conventions Solar-arc contacts (weight 2) and transits from the five slow planets (weight 1) to the Ascendant/Midheaven are scored via contactPoints (full at exact, zero at the orb — SOLAR_ARC_ORB_DEG/TRANSIT_ORB_DEG, both 1°); results report a `lift` over the mean candidate score, since a flat field means the technique explained nothing; capped at MAX_RECTIFICATION_CANDIDATES.
