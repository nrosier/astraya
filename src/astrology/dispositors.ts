/**
 * Dispositor chains, final dispositor and mutual reception (#34).
 *
 * A body's dispositor is the ruler of the sign it occupies. Walking that
 * relationship — "whoever rules the sign I'm in, then whoever rules the sign
 * *they're* in" — either terminates at a body that rules the sign it itself
 * occupies (its final dispositor) or loops back on a body already visited
 * (a cycle, the simplest case of which is two bodies in each other's sign:
 * mutual reception).
 *
 * The chain can only be walked as far as the chart actually has placements
 * for: `positions` must include a longitude for every body the walk reaches,
 * which in practice means at least the seven traditional rulers (plus the
 * three modern outer-planet rulers, if using the modern scheme).
 *
 * Under `both` (co-rulers, #426) a sign has two rulers, but a chain needs one path, so it follows the
 * modern ruler; `isMutualReception` accepts either.
 */

/**
 * @module Dispositors
 * @purpose Walks a body's dispositor chain (sign rulers in sequence) to its final dispositor or a cycle, and checks for mutual reception.
 * @conventions Under the 'both' rulership choice a chain follows the modern co-ruler for a single path; isMutualReception accepts either co-ruler as satisfying reception; the chain can only be walked as far as the caller-supplied positions cover.
