 * Tertiary and minor progressions (#48): two more day-for-X substitutions
 * built on the same idea as secondary progression, just with a different
 * life unit standing in for "one day of ephemeris motion" — see
 * `progressions.ts`'s doc comment for the secondary case this contrasts with.
 *
 * - Tertiary progresses one day for every lunar month of life: the offset
 *   added to the natal Julian day is the number of synodic months elapsed
 *   since birth (`ageInSynodicMonths`).
 * - Minor progresses one lunar month for every year of life: the offset
 *   added to the natal Julian day is the number of years elapsed since
 *   birth (secondary's own `ageInYears`), converted into lunar months.
 *
 * Both recompute bodies and houses directly at the progressed moment —
 * exactly what secondary progression's `'quotidian'` MC method does — since
 * neither technique has competing schools for how the angles should move
 * the way secondary's naibod/solarArc/quotidian split does.
