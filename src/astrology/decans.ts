/**
 * Decans (faces): Chaldean order and triplicity assignment (#26).
 *
 * A decan is a third of a sign, 10 degrees wide — 36 in the full zodiac. Two
 * independent, unrelated schemes assign each one a ruling planet:
 *
 * - The Chaldean "faces": starting from Aries' first decan, the seven
 *   traditional planets repeat in the Chaldean order (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars,
 *   Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon) — but the cycle happens to start mid-sequence,
 *   at Mars, because that is where it lands for Aries. Verified against the
 *   published table (Lilly's "Faces of the Planets"): Aries is Mars, Sun,
 *   Venus; Taurus continues Mercury, Moon, Saturn, and so on with no reset at
 *   sign boundaries — the 7-planet cycle runs straight through all 36 decans.
 * - The triplicity (sign-based) decans: each decan is "ruled" by a sign
 *   rather than a planet directly — the sign itself, then the next sign of
 *   the same triplicity, then the third, cycling from wherever the starting
 *   sign sits in its triplicity. The planet most people mean when they ask
 *   "who rules this decan" under this scheme is that sign's own domicile
 *   ruler (traditional scheme; the system predates the outer planets), so
 *   this module returns that planet directly rather than an intermediate
 *   sign the caller would have to look up rulership for anyway.
