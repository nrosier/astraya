/**
 * Sect (day/night), solar phase (oriental/occidental), and the Sun-proximity
 * conditions cazimi, combustion and under-the-beams (#28).
 *
 * Sect is easy to get backwards, so the reasoning is spelled out rather than
 * assumed: house cusps increase in the same direction as ecliptic longitude
 * as you go from house 1 (the Ascendant) around to house 12, for every house
 * system — that's why house 7 (the Descendant) always falls exactly 180
 * degrees from house 1, and house 10 (the Midheaven, literally overhead) is
 * always in the 7-12 half. So a longitude is above the horizon exactly when
 * it is 180-360 degrees past the Ascendant in the increasing-longitude
 * direction — no house cusps needed, just the Ascendant itself.
 *
 * Orientality follows the same increasing-longitude sweep, but for *time*
 * rather than *height*: the Ascendant sweeps through increasing longitude
 * once per day, so of two bodies, whichever one the Ascendant reaches first
 * rises first. A body behind the Sun (lower longitude, reached by the
 * Ascendant earlier that same rotation) therefore rises *before* the Sun —
 * traditionally called oriental, "of the sun" in the morning sky, and
 * astronomically to the Sun's west. A body ahead of the Sun rises after it:
 * occidental, an evening body, east of the Sun.

/**
