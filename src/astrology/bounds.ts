/**
 * Bounds (terms): Egyptian and Ptolemaic tables (#26).
 *
 * A bound is an unequal-width subdivision of a sign — five per sign, one per
 * traditional planet — used for essential dignity ("in its own bounds") and
 * for peregrine/almuten scoring (#27). Two classical tables assign different
 * widths to the same five planets per sign; neither supersedes the other, so
 * both are exposed and a caller must ask for one explicitly (`BoundsScheme`)
 * rather than getting either as a silent default.
 *
 * Both tables are transcribed from flatlib (github.com/flatangle/flatlib,
 * MIT-licensed), `flatlib/dignities/tables.py`'s `EGYPTIAN_TERMS` and
 * `TETRABIBLOS_TERMS` constants — the latter is explicitly cited there as
 * sourced from the F.E. Robbins translation of Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos (Book 1,
 * Ch. 20-21), which is also the table printed as "Ptolemy's Terms" in
 * William Lilly's Christian Astrology (1647), p. 104 — alongside a second
 * table on the same page, "The Terms of the Egyptians", which is the
 * `'egyptian'` scheme here.
 *
 * Cross-checked against a second, independent open-source transcription —
 * joaoventura/pyastra's `dignities/tables.py` — whose `EGYPTIAN_TERMS` and
 * `TETRABIBLOS_TERMS` dicts agree with the tables below sign-for-sign. (That
 * same file also carries a third table, `LILLY_TERMS`, which it labels "the
 * Ptolemaic terms as described in Christian Astrology" — i.e. a variant
 * transcription of the Ptolemaic table above, not of the Egyptian one; it
 * differs from `TETRABIBLOS_TERMS` on a handful of signs, e.g. Leo and
 * Libra, the kind of small divergence expected between a 1647 printing and a
 * modern scholarly translation. Not implemented here, since the Robbins
 * translation is the more commonly cited primary source for "Ptolemaic
 * terms" in software and the `'ptolemaic'` scheme is documented as such.)
 * Also spot-checked against Astrodienst's own terms documentation
 * (astro.com/cgi/h.cgi?f=gch&h=gch_terms&lang=e); its degree-range boundaries
 * matched throughout, though one planet-to-range label (Gemini) came back
 * transposed relative to both code sources above when read through an
 * HTML-summarizing fetch — attributed to that summarization step rather than
 * to the source page, given two independent, directly-read code sources
 * agree with each other and disagree with only that one summarized reading.
 *
 * Each table's five ranges per sign were checked here to be contiguous, sum
 * to exactly 30 degrees, and be owned by exactly the five non-luminary
 * traditional planets — Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, Mars, Saturn, each exactly
 * once — with no gaps, overlaps, repeats or luminaries (see the completeness
 * test in astrology-bounds.test.ts) as an internal-consistency check on the
 * transcription, independent of the source's own accuracy. Bounds are
 * lower-inclusive, upper-exclusive on [0.0, 30.0) — e.g. Aries's Jupiter
 * bound is [0, 6), meaning 0°00'00" through 5°59'59", with Venus's bound
 * starting exactly at 6°00'00" (see `boundRulerOf`'s `>=`/`<` comparison).
