/**
 * Harmonic charts and Vedic Varga (divisional) charts (#170).
 *
 * The general mechanism behind both is the same: multiply every longitude by a whole number `n`
 * and wrap it back into 0-360. A harmonic chart exposes `n` directly (the classic "fifth
 * harmonic", "seventh harmonic", etc. of harmonic-chart astrology); a Varga chart is the same
 * multiplication under a Vedic name, with `n` fixed by which division the name refers to (D9 is
 * n=9, D10 is n=10, and so on) — see `VARGA_PRESETS` below, which is deliberately just a named
 * table over the one general function rather than a second calculation path.
 *
 * Convention note, since the issue explicitly asks for one (Vedic sources disagree on
 * sign-counting rules, especially for D9): this module uses the single continuous rule
 * `longitude * n mod 360` for every division, including the named Vedic presets. For D9
 * Navamsha this is not a simplification — `longitude * 9 mod 360` lands in exactly the sign the
 * classical Parashari navamsha rule gives, at every sign boundary, because a 30-degree natal sign
 * times 9 spans exactly 270 degrees, i.e. nine navamsha signs starting from a fixed point that
 * depends only on the natal sign's own modality (movable/fixed/mutable) in a way the plain
 * multiplication already reproduces.
 *
 * For D10 Dashamsha, though, this *is* a simplification, and a deliberate one: several classical
 * sources compute D10 by counting nine dashamsha divisions from the natal sign for planets in an
 * odd sign, but restarting the count nine signs further round (i.e. from the sign itself rather
 * than the next one) for planets in an even sign. That odd/even restart is a second, distinct
 * rule bolted onto the general harmonic mechanism, not a consequence of it — this module does not
 * implement it, and instead uses the same continuous `n=10` multiplication as every other
 * division, so that "Vedic preset" always means "a name for one value of the one general
 * mechanism" with no hidden per-chart special case. A reader who wants the odd/even D10 convention
 * instead should treat this chart's D10 as an approximation and check a source that states which
 * convention it follows, exactly as this comment does.

 * Varga practice, so both reasons point the same way.
 *
 * The Ascendant is transformed like any other point; the sign it lands in becomes house 1, and
 * the remaining eleven cusps are the following signs' zeroth degree, 30 degrees apart. Every
 * other angle (`midheaven`, `armc`, `vertex`, `equatorialAscendant`, both co-ascendants,
 * `polarAscendant`) is transformed the same way as a body's longitude, for a single uniform rule
 * rather than a special case per field — several of these (`armc` especially) are not ecliptic
 * longitudes in the natal chart, so this is a documented simplification, not a claim that the
