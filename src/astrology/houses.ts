/**
 * The canonical set of house systems Astraya offers (#19).
 *
 * Swiss Ephemeris identifies a house system by a single-character code passed
 * to `swe_houses_ex2`; this is the list of codes worth exposing in the UI, each
 * given a stable machine `key` so saved charts don't depend on display text.
 * The codes and cusp counts below were read off a live `sweph-wasm` instance
 * (`swe_house_name` and `swe_houses_ex2`), never transcribed from documentation
 * — the project's ephemeris values are always verified against the running
 * library, and house systems are no exception.
 *
 * Display names are deliberately *not* hardcoded here: `src/astrology/**` is
 * pure functions over resolved positions with no WASM, so the human-readable
 * name for a code comes from `EphemerisProvider.houseSystemName`, which wraps
 * `swe_house_name` at the ephemeris boundary. That keeps exactly one source of
 * truth for the text instead of a second copy here that could drift from it.
 *
 * `'E'` is excluded: `swe_house_name` reports it as identical to `'A'`
 * ("equal") — verified empirically, not merely assumed from the letter gap in
 * the alphabet — so it is a legacy alias rather than a distinct system.
