/**
 * Eclipses in a span of time, placed in the zodiac, and their contacts to a natal chart (#404).
 *
 * The eclipse search itself is Swiss Ephemeris' own (`EphemerisProvider.nextSolarEclipse` /
 * `nextLunarEclipse`) — exact umbral and penumbral geometry, not an approximation from node
 * proximity. What this module adds is the astrologer's view of each one: *where* it falls.
 *
 * An eclipse's degree is that of the luminary being eclipsed at greatest eclipse: the Sun (which
 * the New Moon is in conjunction with) for a solar eclipse, the Moon for a lunar one. A lunar
 * eclipse also lights its opposite point, the Sun's degree, so a natal point on either end of that
 * axis is touched; a solar eclipse is read at its own degree and its opposite the same way.
 *
 * **Natal contacts** are the practical reason anyone consults a list of eclipses: an eclipse close
 * to a natal point is the traditionally significant one. The convention, stated rather than picked
 * silently: a natal point is *touched* when the eclipse degree, or the degree opposite it, lies
 * within `DEFAULT_CONTACT_ORB_DEG` (3°) of it — a conjunction or an opposition. Squares and other
 * aspects are not counted; orbs for eclipses are conventionally tight because the effect is read
 * from the eclipse's single degree, not from a moving body's approach.
