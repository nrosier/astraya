/**
 * Exact aspects between two bodies that are *both* moving (#410): the planetary cycles —
 * Jupiter-Saturn's roughly twenty-year "great conjunction", Venus's inferior conjunctions that
 * trace a pentagram over eight years — independent of any natal chart.
 *
 * `transit-events.ts` finds one moving body reaching a fixed natal longitude. This is the same
 * sample-then-bisect idea with the target itself in motion: the quantity tracked is the signed
 * distance of body A from the point at the aspect angle to body B (`B + offset`), and an exact
 * aspect is that distance passing through zero. Because the target moves, *both* bodies are
 * re-queried at every bisection step, not just one.
 *
 * An aspect other than the conjunction (0°) or opposition (180°) is exact at two relative
 * positions — A can be `angle` ahead of B or `angle` behind it — so those are searched
 * separately; the conjunction and opposition are their own mirror image and have one.
 *
 * Sampling at a fixed step is safe for the same reason it is in `transit-events.ts`: the step is
 * chosen from the faster of the two bodies, and a pair's exact-aspect crossings (including the
 * direct/retrograde/direct triple a retrograde loop produces) are weeks to months apart, never
 * two inside one sample interval.
