/**
 * Triplicity rulers: day, night and participating (#26).
 *
 * Each of the four elements has three rulers rather than one, following the
 * table set out by Dorotheus and reproduced by Lilly in Christian Astrology —
 * the version most traditional astrologers use today, as distinct from
 * Ptolemy's own (differently-assigned, participating-ruler-free) triplicity
 * table in the Tetrabiblos. This module implements only the Dorothean/Lilly
 * table; it does not attempt to also model Ptolemy's variant.
 *
 * Which ruler applies — day or night — depends on the sect of the chart
 * (whether the Sun is above or below the horizon), which this module does not
 * compute: that belongs with sect/combustion (#28). Callers who already know
 * the sect pass it in explicitly; this module only holds the static table.
