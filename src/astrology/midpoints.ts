/**
 * Midpoints, midpoint trees, and the 90-degree dial (#30).
 *
 * Two points on a circle have two midpoints, 180 degrees apart. The one
 * conventionally meant — Ebertin's cosmobiology, and every midpoint table
 * since — is the near one: half of the *shorter* arc between them, not the
 * naive `(a+b)/2` (which lands on whichever arc contains longitude 0, an
 * accident of where the zodiac happens to start counting).
 *
 * The 90-degree dial is what makes a midpoint *tree* practical: projecting
 * every longitude onto a quarter-circle (`longitude mod 90`) collapses
 * conjunction, square, and opposition to the same dial position, so a
 * single distance check catches a body in any hard aspect to a midpoint,
 * not only an exact conjunction.
 */

/**
 * @module Midpoints
 * @purpose Computes midpoints between bodies, midpoint trees, and 90-degree dial projections for midpoint analysis.
 * @conventions The conventional midpoint is the near one — half of the shorter arc, per Ebertin's cosmobiology — not the naive (a+b)/2; the 90-degree dial projects longitude mod 90 so conjunction/square/opposition to a midpoint collapse to the same dial position.
