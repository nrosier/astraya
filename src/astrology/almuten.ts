/**
 * Peregrine detection and almuten scoring (#27).
 *
 * Classical essential-dignity scoring weights each of the five dignities a
 * planet can hold at a degree: 5 points for domicile rulership, 4 for
 * exaltation, 3 for its sect-appropriate triplicity rulership, 2 for its
 * bound (term), 1 for its face (decan) — the scheme used throughout, e.g.
 * DCCCXIII/astro's `almuten/figuris.go` implementing Ibn Ezra's Almuten
 * Figuris. A planet with none of the five at a given degree is "peregrine"
 * there (score 0) — traditionally read as lacking any foothold of dignity,
 * for better or worse depending on the planet's other conditions.
 *
 * Only triplicity's sect-appropriate ruler counts (the day ruler in a day
 * chart, the night ruler in a night chart) — never the participating ruler,
 * which is not part of this scoring scheme even though `triplicity.ts`
 * tracks it for other purposes. Sect itself is not computed here: callers
 * who already have one pass it in (see `sect.ts`, #28).
 *
 * "Almuten of a point" is which of the seven traditional planets holds the
 * most dignity at one specific degree (e.g. the Ascendant). "Almuten
 * Figuris" extends that across several degrees at once ("vital points" —
 * classically the Ascendant, Sun, Moon, Part of Fortune's ruler and
 * prenatal syzygy) by summing each planet's score at every point and taking
 * the overall highest. This module implements only that essential-dignity
 * sum: the fuller classical Figuris algorithm also adds planetary-hour and
 * synodic-cycle bonuses that depend on machinery (planetary hours, prenatal
 * syzygy) this codebase doesn't otherwise compute, so those are deliberately
 * left out rather than approximated. Callers wanting the complete algorithm
 * supply their own bonus terms on top of what's returned here.
 *
 * Rulership and bounds each come in more than one scheme (see `dignities.ts`
 * and `bounds.ts`); both are threaded through as explicit, defaulted options
 * rather than hidden behind one hardcoded choice.
