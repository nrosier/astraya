 * plus one file, the fixed star catalog, that the package does not contain at
 * all and is fetched separately. Pinning size and SHA-256 means an upstream
 * repack, or a change to the externally-fetched file, cannot silently change
 * the numbers this app reports: `npm run ephe:sync` fails loudly instead.

/**
 * @module ephemeris/assets
 * @purpose Declares the exact set of Swiss Ephemeris data files, the fixed-star catalog, and the WASM binary Astraya ships, each pinned by size and SHA-256.
 * @conventions Each asset is pinned to an exact byte size and SHA-256 digest so an upstream repack or a change to the externally-fetched fixed-star file is caught rather than silently trusted; `npm run ephe:sync` fails loudly on a mismatch. The shipped `_18` data files cover only 1800-2399 CE.
