/**
 * Which caching strategy a request gets, decided from the request alone.
 *
 * Pure and framework-free on purpose: the service worker's own `fetch` handler
 * (untestable outside a browser) is reduced to "classify, then dispatch", so the
 * actual decision — the part a bug would hide in — is a plain function with a
 * Vitest suite instead of something only exercisable by installing a real worker.
 *
 * The OIDC callback path (`src/ui/oidc-pkce.ts`'s `OIDC_CALLBACK_PATH`) is hardcoded here rather
 * than imported: this file is bundled into the service worker (via `sw-core.ts`), which must
 * never pull in `src/ui/` — a layering boundary this directory otherwise has nothing crossing.
 * Keep the two in sync by hand if the path ever changes.
